**Are you involved with an existing open source project?** Want a team of sharp students give some help? Want to help bring a new generation into the world of open source?

## Sign me up! What are the requirements?

  * The project should be—duh!—open source and have at least some existing users.
  * An aspect/feature/chunk of work suitable for students to work on for a semester
  * Someone to be available to act as a mentor and technical lead during the semester. Additionally, it’s important that this mentor be able to travel to Vancouver for a code sprint from September 17 &#8211; 20 (email us if this is a problem.)

## What kinds of things have students worked on in the past?

  * Helped develop an account setup wizard for Thunderbird
  * Fixed bugs in Mercurial
  * Worked on the geospatial database extensions for Ingres.

## How much will get done?

UCOSP participants are all upper-year students with strong grades and are able to commit 8-10 hours per week.

## I&#8217;d love to get involved. What do I do next?

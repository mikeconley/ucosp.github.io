## Frequently asked questions
  
### Code Sprint and Travel

#### Q: How do I get reimbursed for my travel costs?

You need to send in your itinerary and receipt (often the same document for air travel), and **both boarding passes.  We have to follow procedures set out by auditors who seem to be at least a decade behind the times, so you need to submit a printed boarding pass.

You will probably be given an expense claim.  You do not need to fill in the amounts, but you do need to make sure your mailing address is correct (or fill it in), and you need to sign it.

####Q: When will I get the money back?

It can take 6 weeks or more to process the requests.  Please get your claims in as soon as possible after the sprint.

#### Q: Do I need to bring a laptop to the sprint?

Generally, yes.  The goal is to work for two and half days, so you need to be able to work in the environment you will be working in all term.  Please let the organizers, your faculty advisor, and your mentors know if you don't have a computer you can bring along.  We can sometimes find a loaner machine.

#### Q: When should I arrive?

The sprint starts first thing Friday morning, and ends at noon on Sunday.  Anyone who lives more than an hour away should plan to arrive Thursday evening.  (Please let us know if you are planning to arrive Friday morning so we don't pay for a hotel room that isn't used.)

You should plan to stay at the sprint until noon on Sunday.  This can be a bit tricky for booking flights on Sunday, but please do your best.

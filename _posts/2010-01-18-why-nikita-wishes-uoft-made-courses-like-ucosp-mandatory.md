_&#8220;Do not waste time being jealous: sometimes you&#8217;re ahead, sometimes behind. Race is long and in the end you see that you are only competing with yourself&#8221;._

**T**he reason I switched from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science after my first undergrad year, to be short: it was extremely boring. I did not want to wait for the 3<sup>rd</sup> year to come in order¬† for the stuff to get more interesting. From the first two ‚Äúproject‚Äù courses in my undergrad I learnt zilch.

**I**n CS program things were slightly better: some of the faculty members understood the importance of having a balance between theory, and, well, ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù. In our projects we imitated real software products, developed simple but very cool games (I still play my &#8220;warehouse wars&#8221; JavaScript game when I get bored of XBOX), learn how theory can be sometimes <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">cool</span> useful too.

**H**owever, one aspect was missing from my experience in all of my project / group CS courses: we were never taught to _make real decisions_ about _our own_ project_._ Surely, we were awarded better marks for cleaner code. But as an example, in my second year we weren&#8217;t allowed to:

  1. Write your own socket writeln/readln methods in C. Rational: too complicated, you can&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;ll be hard for us [TA] to test it. Nobody cared that the provided methods were buggy üôÇ
  2. Design your own plugin system for your game: too complicated, you won&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;ll be hard for us to mark it. Well, assignment&#8217;s implementation wasn&#8217;t good at all.
  3. Come up with your own GUI: whaaat? are you insane? you have screenshots in your assignments üòõ

**L**ooks like a list of trivial tasks, but how much thinking, discussion, interaction can each single one of those promote? I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d have a chance to do those things at this university, but I am glad to know that I was wrong.

**N**ot only UCOSP gave me a chance to meet my future colleagues in the field, but it also gave me a taste of what the real world responsibility is like. In short 2.5 days of the sprint I felt a lot of support both from the &#8220;old survivors&#8221; of the project and the new members like myself. I felt a healthy mix of responsibility and support.

**I** think UofT should consider making this course mandatory for students in CS specialist/major programs. I am sure UofT _can_ do that. If the don&#8217;t _want_ to, here is my _why_: I can confidently say that this year I learnt and will learn more about human interaction, project management, responsibility, code practices than in my 4 years of undergrad at UofT. I think that&#8217;s worth something . It&#8217;d be definitely a better investment than a second reading week in December. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">I don&#8217;t read on vacations.</span>

 **Kudos to all organizers, mentors, TAs, and students for making UCOSP possible!**

**I**f you read until here, you are a hero üôÇ

**Short summary of the work done during UCOSP & plans:**

  1. I concentrated on the [Tickets page](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/) of Basie and on the [random-data](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/wiki/random-data-manpage-draft/) tool over these three days. I worked on & closed: [95](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#95), [90](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#90), [82](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#82), [73](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#73)
  2. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Started converting Alex into Linux faith.</span>
  3. I am planning to continue working on random-data, but I will give priority to the tickets assigned to me for **0.6 Final** ([96](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#96), [126](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#96), [74](http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#96))

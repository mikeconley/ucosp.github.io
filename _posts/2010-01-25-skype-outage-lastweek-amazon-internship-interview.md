In the flight sim team we relied on skype for all non-verbal communication. It so happened that there is a [global skype outage](http://twitter.com/Skype/status/8035128397) last Thursday right which happed to collide with our weekly team meeting&#8217;s time. (Good thing that we are using IBM&#8217;s conferce call infrastructure for our meeting.) [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) again proved to be the best way to look for outage information like these &#8211; a quick search for the #Skype hash tag quickly revealed to me that a lot of people are having the same problem, and eventually leads me to the official [@Skype](http://twitter.com/Skype) Twitter account. Although they didn&#8217;t provide any solution but at least you know they&#8217;re working on it. So&#8230; if anything happens next time, give Twitter a try.

In unrelated news, I had an [internship phone interview](http://www.chancancode.com/2010/01/25/amazon-internship-interview/) with [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) today. While I can&#8217;t tell you the exact questions that I was asked, I can tell you that they _love_ [trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). It really pays to know you data structures well! (I wish I know it better before I picked up the phone&#8230;) So&#8230; if you&#8217;re having an internship interview anytime soon, go pick up your DS textbook and make sure you know it inside out!

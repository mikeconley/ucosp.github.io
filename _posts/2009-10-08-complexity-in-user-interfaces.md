One of the reasons I&#8217;m interested in the Eclipse4Edu project is that it is heavily based on user experience. The goal is to create a streamlined IDE for beginners so that they can immediately focus on learning the language and concepts instead of struggling with an environment. Eventually, a novice can move to a classic Eclipse environment while maintaining a sense of familiarity.

One could argue that a beginner could start with the standard Eclipse environment and just ignore the &#8216;advanced&#8217; features. But [minimizing complexity in user interfaces](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/07/minimizing-complexity-in-user-interfaces/) can go a long way.

The challenge is putting yourself in the shoes of a beginner so that you can understand which components are too &#8216;complex&#8217;. Many of the people contributing to the Eclipse4Edu project are far removed from their days as beginners that it can be difficult to gain that perspective.Â  In comparison, as a 4th year student I&#8217;m hardly an expert, but I&#8217;m also finding it hard to recall my first programming experiences.

So how can I get around this? Well, I&#8217;m [designing a questionnaire/survey](http://www.deyalexander.com.au/resources/uxd/surveys.html) that will be distributed to students taking first year programming at Carleton University. Hopefully the feedback will provide the Eclipse4Edu community with some insight and lead to new features and a better product overall.

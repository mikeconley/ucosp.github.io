I am a 3rd year CS and French student, at the University of Toronto (Mississauga campus). I am really excited about taking this course â€“ partly because if the programming challenges, but also because I want to experience working in a large team.

Working in a team where members live thousand miles away from each other is challenging; it forces the members to find new effective ways of interaction to get things done in time. I&#8217;d like to learn more about this, and this course seems to be an excellent opportunity.

Good luck to all students who are taking this course, and lots of patience to our mentors! :]

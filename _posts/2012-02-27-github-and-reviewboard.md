Recently I have been introduced to two new development tools; GitHub and ReviewBoard. In this blog I am going to talk a little bit about each and my experience with using these tools.

GitHub is one of the largest code hosting applications, which provides an ease of sharing codes online and allows other coders to contribute to different projects. GitHub has several advantages; it fuses the best features of a social networking site with a code-sharing forum. Just like a social networking site it has news feeds, followers and a network graph that shows details of how developers have been working on their version of repository. Individuals have options to work on a repository and other individuals can fork it and follow them.

For MarkUs we have placed our code on the MarkUs repository. All the other developers that would like to contribute to the project can fork it and download the code on their local drive and continue working on it. After working on their part of the code it is posted on the ReviewBoard. Other developers that are working on the project then review this code, discuss potential modifications and if satisfied with the results, they are then able to Ship It! Shipping basically means creating a pull request on Github so that the new code can be merged with the existing code on the repository.

ReviewBoard is a web based code review tool that provides simplicity of reviewing code online. It removes the extra effort and time that has been given in the past to reviewing code. It has the tools to identify or highlight, which line of code has been removed and which has been added or changed, making it easier for coders to track the changes. It also allows users to add comments on the screenshots and the changed code.

In my experience working with GitHub and ReviewBoard has been wonderful. It has made it easy for me to work on the code and also keep up to date with the current changes that have been made on the code. GitHub provides the option of keeping a wiki, posting issues, providing notifications and updates on newsfeed. ReviewBoard on the other hand provides the opportunity to post the diffs online and make it easy for discussing the different parts of the diff. These two tools facilitate the sharing of code and remove the barriers that developers face while sharing and reviewing code. Basically these two are great tools for software development and work great with open source projects.

Hello.

My name is Denis. I&#8217;m a third year computer science (AI) at the University of Toronto. I will be working with the Mercurial team.

I chose the Mercurial project because I didn&#8217;t want to be involved in any academia-related projects, and I wanted to work on something with a large number of users. Also, C and python are my favourite languages, and it is sponsored by Fog Creek Software, which seems like a great company, so it would be nice to get on their good side.

As far as programming experience goes, I don&#8217;t have much outside of school related things. Pertaining to school, the best non math course I&#8217;ve taken so far is, without a doubt, Operating Systems. Currently, my most interesting courses (other than this) are natural language processing, intro. to AI, and intro. to visual computing.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the sprint this weekend.

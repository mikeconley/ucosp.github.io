**What we did today:**

  1. Assigned work to each team member, following the agile development style, we now have 10 small, measurable tickets <a title="here" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=211760&atid=1263049" target="_self">here</a> &#8211; the goal of this sprint is to deliver 4 scenarios, and piloting graphical indicator for the next sprint. So we will have enough knowledge of the code in the team when the next sprint begins.

We have our first road blocker today &#8211; the WMDServer does not work on either of our environments, whether it being Mac, Windows 7 or Windows Vista, and we have decided to work on the following items:

  * Use the wiki [here](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/db2mc/index.php?title=Main_Page) to put as much information as we could regarding the problem, and report it to Matthew before midday Jan 18, EST
  * Push the request for a publish server harder, so when the worst scenario happens, we can rotate the usage of the server to finish our work

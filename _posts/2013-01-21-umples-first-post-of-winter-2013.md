Here is the first blog post from Umple, written by Geoffrey Guest.

Flying has never been a joy of mine, however, we made it here in one piece
  
so I guess I can&#8217;t really complain. I met up with another UCOSPer, purely
  
by coincedence, on the way down. It turns out we both fit the bill of
  
&#8220;computer science student&#8221; in our own imaginations. The weekend was already
  
shaping up to be an excellent social and academic experience.

Friday was the day of errors. Yet through them we marched, never getting so
  
stuck as to quit all together and eventually we all came to the same place.
  
The group was a little discouraged by what they thought were fatal errors,
  
but in reality they could continue programming with them. In any case, it
  
was a relief to get on the shuttle and go back to the hotel where we shared
  
in some alcoholic beverages and had a few laughes.

Saturday on the other hand was the day of progress. Having overcome most of
  
the hang up&#8217;s the group started working on issues in full. I had completed
  
some patches prior to the code sprint, so I had some experience, and was
  
delighted to find that my aquired knowledge about the project would now be
  
useful to the others. There were several commits made, one that broke the
  
build but it was definitely progress. And in general everyone was in better
  
spirits. Me and another team member went to the Hobbit which was just as
  
good the second time as the first.

Overall I think the team has made tremendous strides in terms of being able
  
to talk to one another when we have problems, as well as becoming more
  
familiar with the code. Both of these were facilitated quite well by our
  
mentor who was always very encouraging. We must learn to wade into the
  
code, before we can swim in it, and we must do this slowly because or else
  
we will be swept away by the current and be lost. I think we have all
  
learnt a great deal hear at the hackfest, and I&#8217;m sure that we will learn a
  
great deal more by the end of the semester. In the end I think that joining
  
this program is going to be one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve made for my
  
life, and it&#8217;s fun too.

Few topics in programming generate as much argument and as little value as wrangles over where the curly braces should go in C programs, or whether CamelCaseNames or pothole\_case\_names are better [[1](#1)]. That said, consistency definitely matters&#8212;plenty of studies have shown that MiXiNg _styles_ **disrupts** comprehension&#8212;so having a style guide and sticking to it is more important than what the style guide actually says.

I&#8217;m therefore grateful that Google has started [posting its style guides](http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/) for all to read. If your project doesn&#8217;t already have one, and you&#8217;re using a platform Google cares about, adopting theirs is probably the least painful way possible to solve one of the many startup challenges you face.

[<a name="1">1</a>] Short answer: a study in the late 1970s seemed to show that pothole_case was slightly more readable for people who&#8217;d learned English as a second language, but both the effect and the sample size were too small to be reliable.

## **Brenda**

### Status

  * I didn&#8217;t look as much into Scheme as I had intended because in our conference call, Wayne mentioned that the code provided likely can&#8217;t be committed. I decided to look into some other bugs instead.
  * Submitted a patch for Bug 301718 to update the Build Your First Program cheat sheet.
  * Submitted a patch for Bug 299459 to allow the user to rename files (since refactoring has been removed). 

### Next Steps

  * This week, I will look into Bug 299869 some more, to potentially make Java Lite the default perspective.

### Roadblocks

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    Understanding how plugin_customization.ini works, because this file seems to be the key to accomplishing Bug 299869.
  </li>
</ul>

## **Cory**

### Status

  * Very little work done for the past week. My other courses have been dropping a heavy workload on me.
  * Conference call was good and answered my outstanding questions; Will have lots of time this week due to start of reading week. 

### Next Steps

  * Try and knock off 2 outstanding bugs &#8211; Bug 299873 (delete on empty workspace) and Bug 299875 (delete key doesn&#8217;t work in project explorer). 

### Roadblocks

  <li>
    Other classes

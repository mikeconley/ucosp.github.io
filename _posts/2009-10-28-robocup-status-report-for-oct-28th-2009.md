Ioana

Status:
  
&#8211; Has been busy with other midterms

Next steps:
  
&#8211; Finishing neck rotator
  
&#8211; Improving other basic actions. Trying to look at Chani&#8217;s code

Roadblock:
  
None

Alex

Status:
  
&#8211; Testing Yulia&#8217;s log parser and adding few stuff on it
  
&#8211; Running experiment of Decision Tree with different parameters but the result is not very satisfying yet. The goalie (controlled by Decision Tree) barely made a move

Next steps:
  
&#8211; Continuing experiment with different sort of parameters to improve the outcome of Decision Tree

Roadblock:
  
None

Chani

Status:
  
&#8211; Fixed look\_at\_position bug
  
&#8211; Tried to improve dribbling but it didn&#8217;t go so well. Tried to write an action that finds the ball better, but it spins forever; probably a silly mistake somewhere

Next steps:
  
&#8211; Continuing work on dribbling

Roadblock:
  
None

Yulia

Status:
  
&#8211; Finished creating (server) log parser
  
&#8211; Getting a new human player with easier control

Next steps:
  
&#8211; Experimenting with Decision Tree&#8217;s parameters to improve it

Roadblock:
  
None

Patrik

Status:
  
&#8211; &#8211; Read through more of the Role and Action code.
  
&#8211; &#8211; Read client commands section of the manual.

Next Steps:
  
&#8211; &#8211; Attempt to better the action code to use multi-tick features.
  
&#8211; &#8211; Read over Chani&#8217;s changes and provide feedback.
  
&#8211; &#8211; Investigate possibly badly merge human code in the robocup_dt branch.

RoadBlocks:
  
&#8211; &#8211; Midterms, Assignments and Family &#8230;

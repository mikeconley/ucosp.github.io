Up : The great start we had during the code sprint. Wayne Beaton and Dwight Deugo took their time to travel to Toronto and to explain us some really useful concepts and tools. Without them, the team would have started later.

Down : The lack of review from our supervisors. I know that they have a lot to do and that they can&#8217;t hold our hands, but it would have been nice to know if our last submit was good/ok/bad and the reason why they think so.

I&#8217;m on my way home from the 2010 Python Conference in Atlanta, and have written two blog posts: one about [my experiences in general](http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3540.html), and the other about [feedback I got on Basie](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=2231). Long story short, they think that you kids rock, and I think a lot of them will want to be involved if we do this again in the fall. Thank you all for making me look so good&#8212;I&#8217;m proud to be working with you.

Hello everyone,

I&#8217;m Jean (or John, as you like) and I&#8217;ll be working on the Data Center Flight Simulator. I&#8217;m a 4th year student in software engineering at Universit√© Laval and that&#8217;s my last semester, which is great!

Like several students here, that&#8217;ll be my first experience in an open-source project and it&#8217;ll certainly be a new challenge for me. The reason I&#8217;m here is because I wanted to work on something different for my last school&#8217;s project. That should do the job!

My main interests are software architecture, project management and security, but I&#8217;m always looking for something new to learn. The last project I&#8217;ve been working on was a video game that is using a webcam as a controller. The part about computer vision was really nice to learn and use.

That&#8217;s about it See you all this weekend!

Hi, I&#8217;m Ioana Ivan and I&#8217;ll be working on the RoboCup project. I&#8217;m in my forth year at UofT, doing a specialist in bioinformatics and computational biology, but I&#8217;m thinking about staying for an extra year and switching into AI. I&#8217;d like to go to graduate school after I graduate.

Last year, I did an internship at Red Hat, working on the IcedTea/Openjdk team. I&#8217;ve previously worked on a second year research project in bioinformatics at UofT, and a research project on medical imaging at Oxford.

I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting everyone at the code sprint!

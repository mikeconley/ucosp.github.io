Here is a summary of what we&#8217;ve been up to this week. As usual, the IRC  [transcript](https://ucosp.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W32) of the meeting and our more detailed   [status report](https://ucosp.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W29) are posted.

  1. Continued work on our our patches  that were submitted last weeks
  2. Progress with bfiles:

  * Benjamin set up a Linode server for us to develop and test the network-related  bfiles issues
  * Continued  discussion on the  the mercurial-devel mailinglist with seasoned mercurial developers regarding our ideas for autorefresh  and how to keep the bfiles in the respository in a consistant state

After we finished discussing UCOSP-specific issues, we move to the main Mercurial IRC channel where we further discussed getting  rid of bfrefresh, and having the refresh happen automatically.

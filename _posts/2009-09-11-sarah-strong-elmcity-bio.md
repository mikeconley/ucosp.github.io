I&#8217;m Sarah Strong, a third year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, and I&#8217;ll be working on the [Elmcity project](http://elmcity.cloudapp.net/) this semester.

I spent the summer of 2008 working at The Centre for Global E-Health Innovation on their [remote patient monitoring system.](http://www.ehealthinnovation.org/?q=dh) It&#8217;s a rails app that listens for home recorded medical readings and sends out alerts to both doctor and patient if something&#8217;s wrong. It was a fantastic crash course in agile methods and the practical side of software development.

The next summer, I worked on TracSNAP, or Trac Social Network Analysis Plugin. It&#8217;s written in python and flare, and it&#8217;s designed to help developers on large, disorganized code bases connect with colleagues. I learned about program design and the challenges of making a novel app useful and easy to use.

In the past, I&#8217;ve worked as an anti-homophobia workshop facilitator, a conversational English teacher in China, a corporate ghostwriter, a copy editor, and a screen printer, and ran my own business helping people find positive expectation bonuses at online casinos.

Hi everyone, my name is Alex Nico Napitupulu and I go to SFU studying computing science. This term, I&#8217;ll be working on RoboCup project.

I have done eight-month coop term at RIM, Mississauga and I am pretty excited to go back to the fabulous city of Toronto.Â  I also did my coop terms at SAP Business Objects Division, where we developed a reporting software, namely Crystal Reports.

This summer, I worked on an AI project with my professors which is a framework to model and solve combinatorial search and optimization problems (http://www.cs.sfu.ca/research/groups/mxp/). Through this project I developed interest in AI thus I am very enthusiastic to work in RoboCup project.

All in all, I can&#8217;t wait to see and work with all of you guys! I guess we are all gonna have fun with this course ðŸ™‚ .

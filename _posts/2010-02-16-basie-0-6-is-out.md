If you are wondering why Basie team is very cheerful right now, it&#8217;s because we are happy to announce that 0.6 [has been released today](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=2225), very much in time for PyCon. Everyone did her and his share to put this release out of the door and once we take a little break to catch up on our lives and other courses, we&#8217;ll be back working hard to make [0.7](https://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/milestones/5) happen in April.

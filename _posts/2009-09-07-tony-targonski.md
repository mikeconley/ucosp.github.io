Hello, my name is Tony Targonski, and after some quick life decisions and a rocky start in Engineering, I am now well on my way through the Computer Science program at the University of Waterloo. 

While the logistics of the academics were being sorted out, I&#8217;ve administered CompSci.ca&#8217;s [forums](http://compsci.ca/ "Computer Science Canada"), started [a blog](http://compsci.ca/blog "Tony's blog"), and rocked out as one of 2.5 developers behind [GigPark.com](http://www.gigpark.com/ "GigPark.com"), helping to take the startup company from sketches to an acquisition. 

This Fall term I&#8217;m back in school, and will be joining the Basie Project. Having gotten comfortable working with the Ruby/Rails stack, I&#8217;m looking forward to expanding to Python/Django, and more importantly, working with a new team of peers from such a diverse group. 

I hear it&#8217;s a one-in-a-lifetime experience to work with Greg Wilson as well ðŸ˜‰

Hello!

So our project involves making Eclipse soft and fuzzy. So we are trying to hide 90% of Eclipse from the beginner programmer. Currently we are working on trying to hide menu commands and tool bar items in a non-random manner. The challenge is that we are not really creating new code (which there is tonnes of material about) but trying to find the sections of the Eclipse code that we need to modify or overrule and there&#8217;s a lot of Eclipse code to sift through. We are also trying to make class and project creation a bit easier and more consistent.

The Eclipse GUI framework RCP is pretty cool. Seems like a useful thing to know about.

Cheers!

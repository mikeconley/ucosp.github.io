Just felt like sticking a list of potentially useful eclipse shortcuts in one place. Feel free to comment and share some of your favorite keyboard shortcuts for eclipse!

So I will start off with a couple that we shared and learned about from the code sprint last weekend:

  * plugin spy &#8211; alt + shift + F2             (then click something to ID it)
  * open file by name &#8211; ctrl + shift + T
  * delete whole line(s) without selecting all text &#8211; ctrl + d
  * comment out whole line(s)  &#8211; ctrl + /            (Note: can be used to undo commented line too)
  * Organize imports &#8211; ctrl + shift + O
  * Format source code &#8211; ctrl + shift + F

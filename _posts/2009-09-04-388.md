Here is a &#8216;hello&#8217; from Eva Wong for all the UCOSP buddies! I will be working with [Ingres](http://community.ingres.com/wiki/IngresGeospatial) under Andrew Ross for this coming fall.

I’m a fourth year computer science undergraduate student at University of Toronto, specializing in information system. I’m also doing a mathematics minor. For the previous summers in between school years, other than biking, I have been working on the GIS that I found with my team, [Geokudo](http://www.geokudo.com/)(2009), also I have completed a [data visualization tool](http://individual.utoronto.ca/i_wa_wong/VisualizationOfHackyStatData.html) as a GSoC project(2008) for [HackyStat](http://hackydev.ics.hawaii.edu/hackyDevSite/home.do).

I&#8217;m really looking forward to the start of this class, and I will be treasuring this experience. Hope to see you all at Code Sprint!

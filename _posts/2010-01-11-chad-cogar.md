Hey Everyone!

My name is Chad Cogar and I&#8217;m a fourth (fifth? :S) year student at the University of Toronto. My interests lie primarily in systems programming and artificial intelligence, and my experience stems mostly from personal projects (video game and mod development, various web projects) and coursework (CSC369: Operating Systems &#8211; best CS course ever?). My favorite languages are C++ and Python, but I&#8217;ve worked extensively with others as well.

Outside of the realm of CS, I&#8217;m a Psych Specialist and just recently applied to law school. Over the past few years I&#8217;ve also been heavily involved in student life at the college level, particularly student government (hence the extra year of undergrad).

I look forward to spending my last semester working with a number of you on the Basie Project, and I can&#8217;t wait to meet all of you next weekend! ðŸ™‚

Hi my name is Alex Le, I am a 4 year student at UBC. I am working towards a bachelors in Computer Science and minor in Economics. I have previously worked at Business Objects and Macdonald Detwiller and Associates during Co-op and I am interested in web development.

I am looking forward to working with the Basie Team next semester.

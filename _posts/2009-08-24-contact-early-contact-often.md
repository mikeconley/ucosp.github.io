[Ellen Ko&#8217;s post](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/08/contact-early-contact-often.html) on the Google Summer of Code blog is good advice for students doing cross-country projects as well: making contact with your project lead early, and staying in contact regularly during the term, greatly improves your chances of success.Â  Gopal Kapur&#8217;s advice on [how to report status](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/93903/I_m_OK_The_Bull_Is_Dead) is worth reading too: the more direct you are, the more quickly your project lead and teammates can help you.

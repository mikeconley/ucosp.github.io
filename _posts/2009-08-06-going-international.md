Hot on the heels of [yesterday&#8217;s news](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/seven-six-and-five/) about students from Toronto, Waterloo, and Simon Fraser comes word that three students from [Michigan State University](http://www.cse.msu.edu/) will be joining us as well.Â  That brings the total to 21, and it&#8217;s still just the first week of August.

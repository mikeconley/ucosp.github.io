Our final project(s) for the Fall 2009 term are now [on the web](/ingres). There&#8217;s an &#8220;s&#8221; in parentheses because it&#8217;ll be up to the students to decide which of the two we&#8217;ll take on.Â  One involves working with geospatial (map) data; the other is to extend [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com)&#8216;s object/relational mapping layer (the goo that stuffs objects into database tables and restores them as necessary) to work with the Ingres database. Both will give students a chance to work with some very cool technologies; I look forward to seeing who picks them up.

[COMP8440](http://cs.anu.edu.au/students/comp8440/lectures.php) is a graduate-level course on free & open source software (FOSS). Lots of good material here; if you&#8217;re interested, you should also look at Karl Fogel&#8217;s [_Producing Open Source Software_](http://producingoss.com/).

And while I&#8217;m posting links: Pierre Lafayette (a non-student working on Basie) sent a link to <http://browsershots.org/>, which will show you what your web pages look like in a bewildering variety of browsers on various platforms.

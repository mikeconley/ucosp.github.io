My name is François Fournier ( call me frank, it&#8217;s shorter and easier ! ). I will complete my formation in software engineering next fall.  It will be my first contribution to an open-source project, all of my experience in software development came from classes or summer job.

Basie is a good project for me because it will help me to continue my learning of python.

I hope we will have fun during all this semester and I will see you all at Toronto this week-end.

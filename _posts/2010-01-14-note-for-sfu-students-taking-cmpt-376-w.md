_This message is for SFU students who are both in UCOSP and CMPT 376 W._ Given that I&#8217;m your instructor for both UCOSP and 376, I know there&#8217;s a schedule conflict between the code sprint this weekend and Assignment 1 for 376, due Monday.  I&#8217;ll extend the A1 deadline for 376 students also participating in the code sprint:  You have until Wednesday Jan 20 to turn in Assignment 1.  That way you can focus single-mindedly on the sprint.  Enjoy your trip to Toronto!

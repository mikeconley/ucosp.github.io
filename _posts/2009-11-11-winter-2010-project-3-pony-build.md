Pony-build is a simple system for gathering, managing, displaying, and integrating build and test results.   It consists of two core components: a server (for gathering and managing results) and a client library for describing build and test processes.

The project goals are pretty open, but we&#8217;d like to enable features like &#8220;phoning home&#8221; from tests run during installation; integration with test-running frameworks; upload and storage of binary &#8220;-latest&#8221; packages; inclusion and display of code coverage; &#8220;test swarms&#8221; and a leaderboard for the Python community; integration with the Python Package Index; and configurable PubSubHubbub-based &#8220;push&#8221; notification of build events.

Students should be familiar with Python and Web programming; pony-build subprojects will include Web programming and testing, systems administration,package management, and notification implementation.

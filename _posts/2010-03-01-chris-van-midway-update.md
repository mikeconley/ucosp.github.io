Working on Basie has been a blast! And the team, they&#8217;re really a first-class bunch. Well, to quote Greg, Basie has seen a &ldquo;flurry of activity&rdquo; in the recent weeks as we prepared to debut Basie 0.6. We have all done tremendous work fixing many outstanding bugs, discovering new issues and solutions, refactoring a bunch of code, and redesigning the interface.

These past few months I&#8217;ve worked mostly on fixing old issues and redesigning the Dashboard. Now that we&#8217;ve pushed Basie 0.6 out the door, I&#8217;ve begun working on a migration tool to import data from Trac. And I&#8217;d say I am very much on track. ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;m glad I discovered how amazingly useful a tool like ReviewBoard can be. And status reports and weekly IRC meetings have certainly been helpful to see where we all stand, where our priorities should be, etc.

Though we&#8217;re only halfway through the term, I&#8217;m excited to see all the new additions come together soon for our 0.7 release.

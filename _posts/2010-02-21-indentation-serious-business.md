The pony-build team just had our weekly meeting the other night and the following is what people have been working on:

1) Jack has been working on some command line stuff. You can follow his thread [here](http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/pony-build/2010-February/000042.html), for descriptions of his changes as well as what he is planning to tackle next.

2) Fatima has been working on getting her coverage build script finished up and working, as well as refining the HgClone implementation in the pony-build client. You can follow along on her progress [here](http://cherkf.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/37/), which is a great post on never giving up. The following thread all so pertains to her work on HgClone.

Apart from the fact that it&#8217;s great to work on a real project. I believe it was invaluable to meet the programmer behind the name at the start of semester. It gave us the chance to not only meet, but perform a little team building as well rather than just a name somewhere in cyberspace. I think that working in a distributed team like this gave us all an experience that we might not get from some IT companies. I&#8217;m really glad that I had the chance to be apart of this course. If we&#8217;ve learned nothing, the very least we can take away from this project is how to deal with a distributed team in the future. But from the sounds of previous posts, we all have something or another that we can take away.

In Basie, we made it a standard to review code before its submitted. This is not a bad idea, but I decided to split my work into many reviews that took weeks finish. This wasn&#8217;t because the reviews were long, but because as the semester progressed, student reviewers became busy. It became a little difficult to keep things separate when each progressive feature built on top of the previous.

Hi, I&#8217;m Brenda Sadoway and I&#8217;m in my third year of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.  I&#8217;m excited to be working on Eclipse4Edu this semester, after having used Eclipse myself for the first time this fall.  Outside of CS, I&#8217;m also interested in languages (not the programming kind!), reading and playing the piano.  I look forward to meeting you all in Toronto in January!

Hi everyone,

My name is Sylvain. I&#8217;m from the Université Laval, Québec city. This is my last miles to graduate as a software engineer. I will work on Data Center Flight Simulator for this semester. I think that UCOSP will be a great experience to live. I&#8217;m really interested to learn and ready to solve problems.
  

  
I&#8217;m excited to see everyone this week end in Toronto.

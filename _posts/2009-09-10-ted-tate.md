Hi, I&#8217;m Ted Tate and I will be working on the (<a title="Count?" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4-ZBQ_UYgM" target="_blank">Count?</a>) Basie project.

I&#8217;m a fourth year Computing Science student at SFU focusing on programming languages and software engineering.Â  In the past I have worked as a C++ developer including a co-op position at [Safe Software](http://safe.com) working in the spatial data domain. I&#8217;m excited to begin work on the Basie project so I can jump headfirst into the buzzword-laden zoo of web programming.

Hope to see everyone at the code sprint!

Hi all &#8212; I&#8217;m Chris, a junior at Michigan State studying Computer Science and Film Studies. This spring, I&#8217;ll be working with the Basie team. Since middle school, hiding my face behind the computer screen, I&#8217;ve worked on a variety of freelance web development projects (many of which are related to film) and an assortment of contract gigs.

This will mark my first venture into open-source development. I look forward to meeting everyone at the code sprint in Toronto!

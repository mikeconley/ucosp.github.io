We&#8217;re coming up on the end of term, so it&#8217;s time to start thinking about what went right and what went wrong. I&#8217;ve asked the students and mentors to post their ideas here, but to lead off:

Thumbs up: our broad geographic range. I was really pleased to have schools from three oceans (four if you count the Great Lakes) take part.

Thumbs down: most projects weren&#8217;t ready to roll on day one. Next term, each project should try to have a bag full of small, specific tasks for students to tackle during the first few weeks so that no time is lost.

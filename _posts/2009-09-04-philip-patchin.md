Hi, I&#8217;m Philip Patchin, one of the TAs for the Robocup project. I&#8217;m a new MSc student at the University of Toronto, where I also did my bachelor&#8217;s degree. My undergrad included a specialist in artificial intelligence and a major in linguistics, but I am now working in the systems area. I have a significant number of years of industry experience &#8211; and the grey hairs to prove it!

I was involved with the initial CSC49x Robocup course as a volunteer, and I look forward to continuing with the project.

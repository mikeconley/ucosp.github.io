I&#8217;m a fourth year Computer Science student with a minor in Mathematics at Memorial University. I am just coming out of an eight month internship at <a href="http://www.icanmarine.com" target="_blank">ICAN</a>, working on software for the marine industry. I haven&#8217;t yet decided where I want to specialize in Computer Science, but I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and I love programming.

While working at ICAN this year I developed a strong interest in jQuery and web application programming in general, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to working on Basie with the team. I can&#8217;t wait to get to Toronto later this month and work with you all!

I&#8217;m Evan Stratford, a fourth-year CS/C&O student at the University of Waterloo (who is usually slightly more clean-shaven than the above photo would suggest&#8230;) Through my work terms with Google, Facebook, and the National Research Council&#8217;s statistical machine translation group, I&#8217;ve had the chance to pick up a little experience in applications and web development. See you at the upcoming code sprint in Toronto!

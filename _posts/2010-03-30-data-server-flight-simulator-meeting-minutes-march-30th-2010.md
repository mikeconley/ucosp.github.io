**Development Process:**

**Everyone please check out the code at  <https://db2mc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/db2mc/UCOSP/mainline2>**

**Then  make your changes, make sure it runs well on your system, and check it back in**

**The idea is to make sure we have a well-integrated TE-UCOSP by March 31<sup>st</sup>**

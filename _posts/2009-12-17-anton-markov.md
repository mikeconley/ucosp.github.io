Hello everyone!

My name is Anton Markov, and I am a fourth-year Math student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization. I will be working on the Mercurial project in the upcoming Winter 2010 term.

 I am excited to be working on Mercurial for several reasons. First of all, Mercurial is a tool that I have personally used on a couple of co-op terms with great success. Second, I am looking forward to the opportunity of working with both low-level and high-level code in one project. Last but not least, I am excited to work with Benjamin Pollack from Fog Creek Software &#8211; a company that stands apart from the crowd.

A little information about myself: I have lived in Canada since 1996 when my family immigrated from Ukraine. I attended public school and high school in Toronto before moving out to Waterloo to study Computer Science. I&#8217;ve been tinkering with computers since, literally, before I had a computer! In my past co-op terms I&#8217;ve worked at two startups in Waterloo, and my current adventure has taken me to the west coast to intern at Microsoft.

My interests outside of computer science include reading (mostly sci-fi and fantasy), hiking, swimming, and playing my new XBox.

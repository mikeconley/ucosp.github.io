Thumbs up: Sponsors, I liked the fact that we were able to get further acquainted with  large businesses in the computer science field such as Ingres, Tucows, Yahoo, and Rogers Communication.

I think this would also be helpful to gauge experiences and follow-up on progress and accomplishments of other teams. Writing about it is good but I think just as in the sprint, face to face communication is essential

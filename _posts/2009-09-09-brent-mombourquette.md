Hi, I&#8217;m Brent Mombourquette. I&#8217;m in my third year studying computer science at University of Toronto. I&#8217;m aiming for a specialist in Artificial Intelligence, although so far I haven&#8217;t taken any AI related courses.

During this fall I&#8217;ll be working on the RoboCup Soccer project. I spent this past summer working with Professor Steve Easterbrook, developing a Firefox plug-in to aid climate scientists in researching. It was a great experience, although I was working by myself. This will be my first team project and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.

I developed an interest in AI through Â science fiction books a long time ago; the RoboCup Soccer project sounds exactly like what I wanted to do.

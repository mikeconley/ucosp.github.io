  Torontonian part of the team had an in-person meeting today. Pending approval of our Michigan colleagues, we have outlined several important guidelines concerning our future work. A summary of the discussion can be found <a href="http://nikitapchelin.wordpress.com">here</a>. In meantime we are spending the time before the Code Sprint dissecting MySpace and LibraryThing. It&#8217;s fun!

So this week I&#8217;m looking into resursive SQL queries. And my goa? To saturate the CPU with that ðŸ˜€ So normally you&#8217;d want to make your query fast and avoid O(n^2) queries as much as possible, but now I&#8217;m doing the opposite and make it use as much CPU as possible. Kinda awesome you get to do that for a school project isn&#8217;t it!

Thumbs up:  Great experience working as part of a geographically dispersed team.  In all my co-op terms, I&#8217;ve always worked in an office where I could talk to people face-to-face.  Now that my experience has broadened, I expect to be a better team player on future software development projects.

Thumbs down:  Sporadic time commitments.  As a student with 4 other courses, contributing 8-10 hours a week means working sporadically throughout the week when time permits for 1-3 hour chunks at a time.  While not entirely a bad thing, it is sometimes hard to maintain focus, and can seem like the project is moving slowly.  However, the weekly meetings and status updates do help alleviate this.

**ThumbUp: _peer reviews_**. Peer reviews, at least for the Basie team, was certainly a new type of experience in software development. It promoted communication between the team, getting into each other&#8217;s code, writing code that is good enough for others to look at, and then still getting feedback on how to improve it. It creates a better _&#8220;team&#8221;_ feeling, than simply having a group of people commit to the same source code repository. 

**ThumbDown: _peer reviews_**. As good as they were, peer reviews also left a lot more to be desired. It is certainly a different experience now, than at the beginning of the term when most new members on the project were intimidated to both comment on other people&#8217;s code or even have their code be looked at by someone else. I think in the future, it might be a good idea to force the students to break some comfort zones sooner. I would have also liked to see more back&forth _discussion_ of design/performance considerations, rather than one-sided comments on the use of language&#8217;s style guidelines.

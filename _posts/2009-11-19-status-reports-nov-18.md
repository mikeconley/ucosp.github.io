## **Nil**

### Status

  * Found a bug in Dennis&#8217; code while testing the editor. Dennis has repaired it.
  * Participated in the discussion on the following bugs:
      
    &#8211; 294487 : Scheme Play button
      
    &#8211; 294015 : Scheme Package explorer
      
    &#8211; 293093 : Scheme Perspective

### Next Steps

  * Continue work on the Scheme parser with Maxime. 

### Roadblocks

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    The update to kawa 1.9 had broke some part of Scheme4Edu. The worst that could happen is that we will return to kawa 1.8, but I&#8217;m confident that we will repair it next week.
  </li>
</ul>

## **Maxime**

### Status

  * Did a code review and testing of Dennis REPL submission.
  * Found somes issues and Dennis fixed them really fast.
  * Updated the kawa interpreter in the scheme perspective to the latest version but unfortunatly it broke some of the features 
  * Managed to fix most of broken features but there&#8217;s still some left to fix.
  * Made some unit test for Scheme Parser so we can make sure we don&#8217;t have any regression problems.

### Next Steps

  * Continued to work on the scheme parser
  * Fix Kawa features that are broken.

Over on the Basie blog, JP Peters has asked [how you would use tagging](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1241) in a web-based project management tool,while Ted Tate has asked what you&#8217;d like in such a tool&#8217;s [dashboard](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1177). Meanwhile, Farah Juma has been posting ideas for [grade entry in MarkUs](http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=475), and would probably also like to know your thoughts. Next time you&#8217;re tired of staring at your linear algebra assignment, take a moment to give them some feedback, or post a question of your own here (or on your project&#8217;s blog, with a link from here).Â  As in real-world development teams, _you are one another&#8217;s greatest resource_: you&#8217;re even better than Google, because you know more about the context of the question than Google possibly can (at least until Google Telepathy is out of beta).

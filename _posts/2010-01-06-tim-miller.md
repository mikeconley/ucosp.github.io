Hi everyone!

I will be working on Thunderbird for the upcoming term.  I am excited to be part of UCOSP and looking forward to my first open-source experience.

I&#8217;m currently a senior at Michigan State University studying Computer Science.  I already have a degree in Japanese language, and I have taken enough other classes that I could probably have minors in physics and economics too.  I have worked at the university computer help desk fixing viruses and other problems for the last four years or so, but I am starting a new job this semester programming for one of the departments on campus.

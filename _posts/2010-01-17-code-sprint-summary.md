TODO’s
  
 Get a duplicated copy of GeoTools repository for UCOSP own builds
  
 Install Geoserver. Do preliminary testing with PostgreSQL w/ PostGIS, feeding to GeoServer
  
 Continue studying the code and understand how JDBC works to connect to difference databases in GeoTools
  
 Break down the database connectivity code among developers
  
 Assign the following tasks
  
o 2 developers
  
o 1 tester
  
o 1 project manager, where half the time is spent on project management, the other half as developer
  
 Contact Frank W for building Ingres on his server and set up username and password for us. We can then SSH into his server if we need.
  
 Post a sprint summary for Greg to log down our findings the past few days
  
 For each of us, log down meeting minutes in our own blog every week for our phone chat with Andrew (?)
  
 Design Document
  
Should contain the following:
  
o List of files needed for GeoTools to run with Ingres
  
o A class diagram for the Ingres design
  
o A diagram displaying the architecture of our project
  
o A test plan that assesses the validity of our code for GeoTools with Ingres
  
 Create a video showing how Geotools works with Ingres

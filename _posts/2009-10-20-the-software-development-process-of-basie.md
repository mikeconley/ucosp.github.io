Recently I attempted to describe what kind of process we used while developing Basie. My first shot at the definition was a little off, but it turns out that there is [no clear definition](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1401) for how weÂ  do things. I&#8217;m looking for some feedback from fellow students on what they think of our current process and how they would go about defining it. I&#8217;m planning on coming up with another revision of this definition once I hear what others have to say. I&#8217;m sure there are people out there who have plenty of experience when it comes to this, so please, check out the [Basie blog](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1401). I would love to hear your feedback.

Minutes by: Maciej

&#8211; Discsussed difference between having a different perspective for each programming language and having everything in one tab.
  
-> Note: Scheme users will generally be more advanced than Java users (might already be familiar with perspectives)
  
-> Easier to have different perspectives.

&#8211; Considered Debuggers for Java and Scheme
  
-> Do we want a debugger intergrated into the Java perspective?
  
-> Need more research for a Scheme debugger

&#8211; Renaming the Java Lite perspective
  
-> We&#8217;re not ready for a big change like that yet.
  
-> This will take more discussion
  
-> Renaming the implementation details (ie. Class Names, Package Names) must be done carefully
  
-> The change won&#8217;t have to go through the Eclipse IP process if done by a commiter (Wayne/Dwight)

&#8211; Discussed developing an RCP applications vs using the org.eclipse.ide4edu.releng project

&#8211; Talked about Scrapbook pages in Eclipse vs. Beanshell
  
-> Maxime will observe first year students using each one

TODO: Capture some usage senarios of first years using IDE4EDU. (Wayne will send out an email with more detail.)

Hey! I&#8217;m Holly Becker and I&#8217;m working on WikiDev.

I&#8217;m in my third year at SFU, majoring in Computer Science, like most of us here. My computer-related interests are mostly in operating systems, applications programming and networking, though most other aspects of computers interest me. It&#8217;s very exciting to be getting into the interesting upper-division computer courses.

This summer, I was a C++ programmer with a local games company, which was my first time programming in a production environment. It was quite an experience, and I look forward to this being my second.

While I may not be as experienced as many of the other UCOSP participants, I look forward to learning, and working with my teammates.

See you in Toronto!

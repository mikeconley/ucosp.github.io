Courtesy of Andrew Ross, two videos that students should watch:

  * [Top reasons for success or failure in Google Summer of Code](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgUHbmh2Qgs)
  * [Same title (part 2)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF5kMGvoFt4)

Summary: communicate, communicate, communicate&#8230;

And while you&#8217;re at it, you may want to check out some [Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/) talks, like this one about [restoring the Archimedes Palimpsest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3IP_FmGams), or this one on [how to win at Scrabble](http://ignite.oreilly.com/2009/09/mehal-shah-on-how-to-win-at-scrabble.html). If you haven&#8217;t run into Ignite before, it&#8217;s 20 slides on an automatic timer set for 15 seconds per slide, so the whole talk is over in 5 minutes. [Waterloo&#8217;s first Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/2009/09/first-ignite-waterloo.html) is in November; I&#8217;ll be asking all Toronto students to do a presentation in this style at the end of the term.

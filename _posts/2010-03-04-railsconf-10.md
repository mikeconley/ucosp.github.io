For those who are interested, [RailsConf &#8217;10](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010) has been announced. With the merge with Herb and the release of Rails 3 (now in beta), this year&#8217;s RailsConf is going to be awesome. You can save $100 by registering before April. IN ADDITION to that, full time students can receive a 65% off discount using the promo code &#8220;rc10fts&#8221;.

(I&#8217;d love to be there this year, but I&#8217;ll need to ask for permission from my employer. We&#8217;ll see how that goes&#8230;)

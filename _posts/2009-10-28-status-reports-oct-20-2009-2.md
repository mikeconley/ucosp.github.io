## **Nil**

### Status

  * Submitted the Scheme Perspective bug (293093). 
  * Maxime and I have been brainstorming on the features that we want to add in Scheme. 
  * Maxime and I have examined the possibility of adding a debugger, but we are stuck between IP process. 
  * We have found PSD (Portable Scheme Debugger), but the way the debugger works is by generating ans instrumented version of the real code, so it&#8217;s really slow and it doesn&#8217;t execute the same way as the orignal version.
  * Working to create a list of goals to achieve for grading scheme, due Oct 31. 09

### Next Steps

  * Create bugs for Scheme work to be discussed at call-in on Oct 29.

## **Maxime**

### Status

  * Wrote to R. Kent Dybvig and Abdulaziz Ghuloum the author of the Scheme file "psyntax.ss" that had a licensing issue in bug #242444 and they answered
      
    that the latest version was under the "MIT" license so we could now use the SISC interpreter without any legal issue.
  * Made a french version of the survey that Dennis had made. The second semester student that have a computer course have completed it. 
  * Nil and I have brainstormed on editor features that we think make sense for scheme. 
  * Began to work on the "scheme repl" views but was not fixed on which interpreter to use so switched to the "code editor" instead.
  * Working to create a list of goals to achieve for grading scheme, due Oct 31. 09.

### Next Steps

  * Create bugs for Scheme work to be discussed at call-in on Oct 29.

Over on the Google Open Source blog, [Robert Konigsberg](http://konigsberg.blogspot.com/) has posted about [Google&#8217;s recent Eclipse Day](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/09/eclipse-day-at-googleplex-2009.html). And there are videos! I might wish that Eclipse had a smaller memory footprint or simpler APIs, but there&#8217;s no arguing with the vibrancy and passion of its developers and user community.

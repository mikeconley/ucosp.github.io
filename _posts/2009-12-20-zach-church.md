  Hi,
</div>

My name is Zach, and I&#8217;m a second-year Computer Science student at Michigan State. I&#8217;ll be working with the Thunderbird team this semester. I have experience with C, C++, Ruby, Python, and Javascript. I&#8217;ve worked on several web applications, but haven&#8217;t done much with desktop applications yet, so I&#8217;m excited to work on Thunderbird!
  
See you in Toronto!

Zach

We&#8217;re bringing this term&#8217;s students together in Toronto January 15-17 for three days of discussion, coding, and fun.Â  Some of the details are still being worked out, but here&#8217;s what we know so far:

  * The sprint starts at 9:00 am on Friday, Jan 15, and will finish mid-afternoon on Sunday Jan 17.
  * We&#8217;ll be using Room 2200, Room 2230, and Room 2270 in the Bahen Centre at [40 St. George Street](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=40+st.+george+street+toronto+ontario&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=37.052328,74.707031&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=40+St+George+St,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario,+Canada&z=16) on the main campus of the University of Toronto.
  * Out-of-town students will stay at the [Holiday Inn on Bloor Street](http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hotel/yyzbs) (about a [10-15 minute walk](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=280+Bloor+St+W,+Toronto,+ON,+Canada&daddr=40+st.+george+street+toronto+ontario&hl=en&geocode=FadQmgIdP3BE-ykRZ_OovTQriDHVkw0QCVbO-A%3BFW0xmgIdIYBE-ykRyNZaxzQriDE_3QhtoE2hRQ&mra=ls&dirflg=w&sll=43.659629,-79.396831&sspn=0.008274,0.018239&g=40+st.+george+street+toronto+ontario&ie=UTF8&ll=43.663588,-79.398708&spn=0.008274,0.018239&z=16) from the Bahen Centre, depending on how long your legs are and how cold it is).
  * It&#8217;ll be cold.
  * We&#8217;re providing pizza for lunch on Friday, and dinner at Bright Pearl ([346 Spadina Avenue](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=40+St+George+St,+Toronto,+ON,+Canada&daddr=346+spadina+avenue+toronto+ontario&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&dirflg=w&sll=43.664519,-79.398708&sspn=0.063083,0.145912&ie=UTF8&ll=43.656773,-79.398043&spn=0.008274,0.018239&z=16)) that evening.

I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting everyone!

## **Brenda**

### Status

  * Submitted a patch for Bug 303426 that fixes the unresolved issues with the previous patch. The package dropdown menu should now list the packages in the currently selected project, and update when a different project is chosen. The patch also makes sure the default package is listed as "(default package)" rather than a blank line.

### Next Steps

  * Look into issues with the NewJavaClassConstructor class. Specifically, address Bug 303581 and several of the TODOs and FIXMEs in the code where possible. 

### Roadblocks

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    Class deadlines and more midterms.
  </li>
</ul>

## **Cory**

### Status

  * Did a little bit of work on my DND implementation. 
  * I didn&#8217;t get a lot of time over the past week to work on eclipse. I&#8217;m allocating some more time towards eclipse later this week. 

### Next Steps

  * Continue work on DND implementation. I need to refactor the code, and fix some more bugs. I hope to post an updated bug patch within the next week. 

### Roadblocks

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    Other classes
  </li>
</ul>

## **Miles**

### Status

  * Refactored sections of the new Class creation wizards and constructors using the extension point for templates as suggested by Wayne. I am making progress on this but doing this correctly and in a way that will be easy to maintain has been time consuming.

### Next Steps

  * Figuring out how to simplify the menus and toolbars.
  * Add further functionality to the Class creation constructor and wizards specifically relating to packages.
  * Make is so the Package field in the Class creation wizard is only displayed if there are packages created in the workspace.

### Roadblocks

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    None.
  </li>
</ul>

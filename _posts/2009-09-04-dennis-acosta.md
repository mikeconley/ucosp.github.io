  Hi. My name is Dennis Acosta. Iâ€™m a fourth year student of computer science and psychology at Carleton University, having previously studied computer programming at Seneca College. My primary areas of interests are in human-computer interaction, and more recently, location-based services.

  This Fall term I will be working on the Eclipse4Edu project. I look forward to the challenges ahead and am excited to get started on this incredible opportunity.

  Thank you to all the organizers of these unique projects and best of luck to all the students.

Diane: working on Ticket#2949863, integrating the graphical indicator in TE.

Godfrey: finished Mike/Sylvian&#8217;s scenario.

Jean: working on ticket#2948712 to see if the scenario I created last week is not influenced by any other variables.

**What&#8217;s next:**

Diane and Lenny will be continuing on integration and input definition during the weekend.

Godfrey will be working on CPU tickets while waiting for the integration to complete.

Jean:

&#8211; will be working with Sylvain this weekend to continue working on this ticket and we&#8217;ll probably work on creating a dial with the help of Diane and/or Lenny.
  
&#8211; trying to find other variables that could help in analyzing the problem.

**Important upcoming deadlines:**

**Feb 16 &#8211; complete integration and input definition on graphical indicator**

**Feb 25 – Video of scenario from start to finish with graphical indicators**

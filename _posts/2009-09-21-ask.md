A week ago, Jon Udell put up a post on his blog titled, &#8220;[Ask and ye may receive, don&#8217;t ask and ye surely will not.](http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/09/14/ask-and-ye-may-receive-dont-ask-and-ye-surely-will-not/)&#8221; Yes, there is such a thing as pestering, but in our experience, students are far more likely to ask too _few_ questions than too many.Â  So, if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing, don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re supposed to do it, or feel like you&#8217;re missing some crucial piece of information, please email your project lead and cc Greg&#8212;we&#8217;re here to make your lives better :-).

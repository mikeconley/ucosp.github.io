Peter from UofT checks in:

ReviewBoard is a web service which facilitates code review amongst developers
  
within a repository (Git, SVN, etc). The project I am working on is an
  
implementation of TogetherJS, an extension (or plugin) that organizations can
  
choose to install within their instance of ReviewBoard. TogetherJS is a
  
javascript library that allows multiple users to discuss a webpage through
  
text and voice chat and live cursor interaction. A demo is available here.
  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfbREmTBjc> It is similar to screen sharing
  
on Skype but has limited capabilities. Some of the features I have been
  
assigned to implement are to decouple this service from the Mozilla servers
  
and to reduce dependency on WebRTC. There will be an interesting balancing act
  
between taking advantage of all the available tools from the library and
  
keeping the extension a standalone project that services the needs of
  
ReviewBoard. The objective of this project is to help multiple developers
  
discuss a single commit in real time while in remote locations.

The most important lesson I have learnt in UCOSP is that this is not a course.
  
There are supervisors from the faculty, mentors of the project and peers.
  
However, there are no lectures, no assignments, no deadlines, no tests.
  
Throughout undergrad, attending lectures, keeping tabs on assignment and test
  
deadlines, and starting early to meet these demands helped me succeed. However
  
this does not work well with UCOSP. UCOSP requires a different type of
  
dedication. You really need to set aside time to work on it on a regular
  
basis. Furthermore you need to ask questions frequently. Itâ€™s very unintuitive
  
because with regular courses, the more time you spend on a problem on your
  
own, the more you learn. The opposite is true here. The more time you waste
  
trying to solve something on your own, the worse your overall performance. It
  
is much more productive to consult your mentors at every roadblock. Some
  
people may find asking many little questions bothersome but the mentors love
  
it. If they did not like helping, they would not have become mentors. The
  
UCOSP learning experience is really different, but there is no reason you can
  
not succeed because there is so much help available if you take advantage of
  
it.

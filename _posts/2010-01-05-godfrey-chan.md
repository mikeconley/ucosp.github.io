Hello guys! As you can see in the picture, I just returned from a ski trip which explained the lateness of this post, but finally, here it is!

I&#8217;m a third year CS student at [SFU](http://www.sfu.ca), with a concentration in computer systems and a minor in cognitive science. My programming experience began in the early 2000s when I first learned to create webpages with HTML and eventually dynamic websites with PHP and MySQL. My interest in this exciting ﬁeld has since blossomed into a serious passion.

In this semester I will be working on the [Data Center Flight Simulator](http://bit.ly/data-fs) project with [Michael](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/michael-man/) and some other nice folks from UT. I definitely look forward to meet everyone in the Code Sprint!

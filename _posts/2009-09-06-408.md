Hi everyone. My name is Mary Mootoo and I will be working on the Ingres project this semester. I am a computer science senior at the University of the Virgin Islands on the St. Croix Campus.

I have been exposed to different computer languages such as C++, Java, Perl, and Visual Basic. I have never worked in Python before but I’m sure I will have fun on this project. I am anxious about seeing how we will all cope with the distance between us.

I look forward to having a wonderful experience working with everyone and I can’t wait to meet everyone in Toronto.

_The tutorial will have an entry to open up a page with dials just for that tutorial (in the same page of the tutorial)._

**Individual tasks:**

Matthew:

  * Peter is happy with the videos
  * Prototype done for Lenny’s work, due by the end of day today

Diane & Lenny:

  * Diane Will work with Alan to set up the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">latest version</span> of WMD on the server

Note: there are some changes in xml format on the WMD, when a person tests his code on the server, he should make the change accordingly, it is up to you if you want to install the latest WMD or not(you may have to spend another 3 days on that, take the risk if you want)

  * Working on the bar, talking to Matthew on his problem, going to upload the code by the end of day today

Godfrey & Michael:

  * Michael is merging everyone’s code in the repository and create a release. Expected to be ready by the end of day today
  * Will work together on Friday

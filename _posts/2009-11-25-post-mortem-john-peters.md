Apparently posting within the day isn&#8217;t early enough; there are almost two pages already.

I&#8217;d like to echo [what Josh said](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/two-more-thumbs-for-ucosp/), both the good and the bad. The best courses in my undergraduate have been the ones [where I&#8217;ve done &#8216;real&#8217; work](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/current/iip/), and the more opportunities I have to do such things the better. Also echoing the &#8216;deadlines&#8217; section of Josh&#8217;s post: I&#8217;ve definitely needed to apply triage this semester, for all my courses, not just UCOSP. It really is unavoidable with a fourth year workload. I&#8217;d prefer taking hard but interesting courses at the cost of lower marks, rather than taking &#8216;soft&#8217; options and not getting my tuition&#8217;s worth. Still, it&#8217;s a balancing act when every professor thinks his or her course is the toughest one you&#8217;re taking this year. [1]

Anyway, here&#8217;s my own thumbs up / thumbs down:

Thumbs up: This may be Basie specific, but I enjoyed the amount of support we received from grad students and people who previously contributed to the project. Having U of T undergrads who already logged time on the project helped as well. Without that guidance, the work done this term would have been much more disorganized.

Thumbs down: Beggars can&#8217;t be choosers, but most of the UCOSP projects were web-based, and those that weren&#8217;t filled up quickly. Also, nearly every project has a focus on education, or has programmers as their targeted users. This is likely a result of the UCOSP profs selecting projects familiar to them, and due to the open-source mentality of &#8216;scratching your own itch&#8217;.

[1] Hey Jay, we should totally make &#8220;I Survived Compilers&#8221; t-shirts at the end of this term. That is, assuming we _do_ survive compilers.

My QA teacher recently pointed us to the following [interesting paper](http://people.canonical.com/~ianc/papers/community-agile/community-agile.html). It describes a process framework for development in a distributed (optionally open-source) context. They call it _Community-Agile software guidance_.

Though no single process framework can apply to every projects, you&#8217;ll find that many recommendations in that paper are nowadays must-follow rules (those regarding quality in particular). I also like the way the author presents growing software as compared to a living creature that ought to be surrounded by an appropriate community in order to fully blossom and how that software needs to be _guided_ toward maturity as it grows.

I believe it is a must-read to all of us doing distributed open-source development. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.

Thanks to the generosity of our [sponsors](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/sponsors/), we are going to bring all of the students taking part in these projects together in Toronto Sept 25-27 for a three-day code sprint. This will give teams a chance to get to know each other in person, and to firm up their goals for the term. I&#8217;ll post more details about travel and accommodation arrangements as we have them.

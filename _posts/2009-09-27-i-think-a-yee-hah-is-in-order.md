We&#8217;ve wrapped up our Fall 2009 code sprint, and I think a bit of self-congratulation is in order: things went very well. I&#8217;d like to thank all the [students](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/students/) for giving three good days, and everyone else who made it possible&#8212;in no particular order:

  * Wayne Beaton (Eclipse Foundation)
  * Steven Case (University of the Virgin Islands)
  * Dwight Deugo (Carleton University)
  * Karen Reid (University of Toronto)
  * Andrew Ross (Ingres)
  * Blake Winton (Thunderbird)
  * Rick Yazwinski and Jody Stocks (TUCOWS)
  * Mike Conley, Phil Patchin, Michael Reimer, and Zuzel Vera Pacheco (University of Toronto grad students)

Special thanks to Alan Rosenthal for setting up our computers and networks&#8212;everything ran perfectly all weekend long&#8212;and to our sponsors: Ingres, the Open Source Lab, Rogers, TUCOWS, and Yahoo!.

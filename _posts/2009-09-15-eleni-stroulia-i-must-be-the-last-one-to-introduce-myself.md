hello all
  
I am Eleni Stroulia, the very excited leader of the WikiDev team this term!

I am Greek by birth and Canadian by choice. I started my research in AI, back when knowledge engineering and model-based systems were all the rage (the implied time period will be on the test:-). Since I joined the U of A, I have been working on software engineering solutions for industrially relevant problems. To these problems I usually apply AI methods to semi-automate human processes. My research agenda includes work on software reengineering and migration, service-oriented architecture, collaborative software, smart environments, and virtual worlds.

My group, known as the &#8220;Service Systems Management&#8221; group, is always looking for talented graduate students, with a good work ethic and a sense of humor. Check us out at <http://ssrg.cs.ualberta.ca/index.php/Main_Page> and, if you are at all tempted, let me know!

Cheers

I&#8217;m speaking at [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/) on Saturday. The blurb I sent in says:

> **_What We&#8217;ve Learned From Building Basie_**
> 
> Since September 2008, teams of undergraduates from half a dozen different universities have been building a Django-based replacement for Trac called Basie. This talk will present what they&#8217;ve accomplished and discuss what we&#8217;ve learned about getting junior developers who are juggling half a dozen projects at once to build production-quality code.

I&#8217;d enjoy hearing from past and present project students&#8212;49ers, GSoC and UCOSP alumni, and everyone else, not just those who worked on Basie&#8212;about what they got out of the various project courses I have run, and why.

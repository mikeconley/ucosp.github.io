Hi all,

a while ago, Greg asked me to post something about why &#8220;continuous integration&#8221; was important and useful and awesome and absolutely critical and &#8230; whatever else.  I finally [wrote that up](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/dec-09/why-buildbots.html) and I am interested in your thoughts.

Note that the pony-build project (available **this term!!** as a UCOSP project!) is meant to address some of the deficiencies in the current CI options for (especially, but not limited to) Python projects.

Also, if any of the other UCOSP projects are interested in collaborating to get _their_ code building under pony-build, please let us know.  It strikes me as a dandy way to synergize our efforts with a team-directed focus on enterprise approaches.

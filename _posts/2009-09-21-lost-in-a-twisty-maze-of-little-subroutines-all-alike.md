Many great computer scientists and educators have observed that while we teach students to write code, we don&#8217;t teach them to read it [[1](#1)]. When you think about it, it&#8217;s ridiculous: architects study hundreds of buildings before designing one of their own, novelist probably read _thousands_ of books before trying to create their own masterpiece [[2](#2)], and only mathematicians can count how many proofs they go through in detail during their training, so why don&#8217;t programmers study great programs to improve their craft?

One of the few people who&#8217;s actually done something about this is Diomidis Spinellis. His two books [_Code Reading_](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Reading-Open-Source-Perspective/dp/0201799405) and [_Code Quality_](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Quality-Open-Source-Perspective/dp/0321166078) are respectively an explanation of how to read large C/C++ programs meant to build and run on Unix, and how to tell good code from bad code. Both are worth reading, as is his [blog](http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/).Â  Just last week, for example, he described [how he tracked down a bug in a regular expression library](http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20090916/). I tried to do something last year when I recorded myself [reading through a medium-sized piece of Python](http://www.third-bit.com/pages/reviewing-markdown.html). I&#8217;d be very interested in pointers to similar material, i.e., to examples of people reading and reviewing code in public.

[<a name="1">1</a>] I&#8217;ll award 5 millimarks each to the first three people to find quotes online to back this up.

[<a name="2">2</a>] Though in [Dan Brown&#8217;s case](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6194031/The-Lost-Symbol-and-The-Da-Vinci-Code-author-Dan-Browns-20-worst-sentences.html), it doesn&#8217;t appear to have helped.

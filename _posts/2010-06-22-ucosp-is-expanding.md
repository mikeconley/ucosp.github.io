UCOSP, the distributed undergraduate capstone course, is preparing for another year and we need your help!

Forgot what UCOSP is? Here&#8217;s a refresher.

> **Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects** **brings together students from coast to coast to work together on joint capstone projects.** Students learn first-hand what distributed development is like. Each team has students from two or three schools, and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead.

Need to know more? We have answers to your questions on our [About page](http://ucosp.ca/about/).

In preparation for this September, we&#8217;re looking for:

  * **Students**: Work on an open-source project with other students from across the countryâ€”for credit! What could be better?
  * **Faculty mentors**: We&#8217;re looking to expand the number of schools participating this year.
  * **Open source mentors**: Are you involved in an open source project? Help a team of students make a contribution to your software.
  * **Industry sponsors**: We need your help to bring students together for a code sprint at the beginning of the semester.

If this has caught your interest, please get in touch via email: <admin@ucosp.ca>. Looking forward to hearing from you!

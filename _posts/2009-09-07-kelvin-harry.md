Hello everyone, my name is Kelvin Harry, I was born and raised on the beautiful island of St Thomas in the Virgin Islands.  I attend the university of the Virgin Islands. At first major was business, but now I am a senior Computer Science major.

The field of study in computer science that I am most interested in is Bionformatics. This past summer I got the opportunity to participate in a research experience in computational biology at the University of Georgia. My research focused on Horizontal Gene Transfer analysis in Cyanobacteria, this experience allowed me to gain valuable experience in the field of Bioinformatics. I also participated in another summer REU program in 2008 where I  studied software design. me and my teammate worked on software for a mobile device and the  paper written detailing this research will possibly be published soon.

I&#8217;m excited to work on the Ingres project and I can&#8217;t wait to see you all soon!

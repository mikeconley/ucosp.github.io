Hello there, I&#8217;m Miles and I&#8217;ll be working on Eclipse IDE for Education project. I&#8217;m looking forward to learning about working on open-source projects and the Eclipse GUI framework.

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1949" title="Miles Billsman" src="http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/miles-bw-by-pete-on-fuji-241x351.jpg?w=205" alt="" width="205" height="300" />](http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/miles-bw-by-pete-on-fuji-241x351.jpg)

_&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m writing a dating profile &#8211; &#8220;I like moonlit walks on the beach and death metal bands that dress up like goblins.&#8221; &#8230;_

I&#8217;m a 4th year student at University of Toronto so I&#8217;ll be graduating and getting a jobby-job shortly. I&#8217;m interested in HCI, artificial intelligence and computer graphics. I did a project course for something called PySpection this summer. It is a visual debugger for Python aimed at first year students.

In a previous life before returning to school I was a graphic designer doing packaging for beer, cigarettes and pharmaceuticals among other things. If there was a way that packaging could encourage you to enter a downward spiral, we were there. So if you need something to look good let me know, I may be able to help.

Cheers, Miles

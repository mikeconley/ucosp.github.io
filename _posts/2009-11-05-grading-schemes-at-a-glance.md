I think that writing these is a more important part of the software engineering process than most students realize. A grading scheme is the academic equivalent of a contract of deliverables: it&#8217;s the thing that you and I can put in front of a judge or some other third part if we disagree over whether you&#8217;ve delivered what I thought was promised.  Some parts of these grading schemes, like 10% for playing well with others, don&#8217;t show up in such contracts because they&#8217;re just assumed: if you don&#8217;t play well, you don&#8217;t keep your job [1]. Many of the rest, though, are exactly what I&#8217;d expect as a consultant: feature X, able to do Y, tested by Z.  I&#8217;ve experimented in my regular software engineering course with having students write their own assignment specs, and the more I do it, the more important I think it is. I&#8217;m curious to know what the students themselves think&#8230;

[1] Unfortunately, this often isn&#8217;t true: I&#8217;ve worked beside people who were awful human beings, but somehow never got fired. There are lots of reasons why this happens; it&#8217;s a good subject for a future blog post.

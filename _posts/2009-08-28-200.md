I spoke yesterday with Jon Udell about goals for [ElmCity](/project-elmcity/) for this fall. He has since posted two very cool things:

  1. [Using FriendFeed to manage a loosely-coupled team](http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/08/27/friendfeed-for-project-collaboration/). Pulling project members&#8217; own blog postings, Facebook status updates, tweets, and the like together in one place is probably as cost-effective a way to manage a team as the usual mailing list + IRC channel.
  2. A lengthy description of [how to make elmcity and WordPress play nicely together](http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/08/15/elmcity-and-wordpress-mu-questions-and-answers/). A calendar aggregator plugin for WordPress would be very cool (think about a blog for your city that aggregated and displayed events harvested from neighborhood-level blogs), but Jon&#8217;s description of how it works is a good intro to elmcity for would-be curators.

Please check them both out and let him know your thoughts.

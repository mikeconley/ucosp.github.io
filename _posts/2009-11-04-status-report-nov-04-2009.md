## **Nil**

### Status

  * For the Thursday IRC meeting, made a list of what needs to be done if we want to have a great Scheme product. Working with Maxime on this task since Tuesday, so we were helping each other.
  * With Maxime, took SchemeWay to do the Scheme perspective(293093), outline and editor. As for now, it is SchemeWay without modification, but we will take some time to remove the stuff we don&#8217;t need before submitting it on bugzilla.

  * Team met up on IRC and decided that we&#8217;ll have meetings twice weekly. 
  * Decided to switch gears and work as a team on the scheme perspective. 
  * Consolidate Scheme changes and put them on the bugzilla for the IP team to have a look.

## **Maxime**

### Status

  * Changed the Scheme files that had licensing issues in the scheme interpreter, and managed to make a build and run with those changes.
  * Contacted the SISC community to ask them if this can get integrated in the main SISC source control so we can update to the latest SISC without 
      
    having to worry about those changes in the future. 
  * I made pie charts from the survey that I have did with Sherbrooke students. They have been posted to the ucosp blog.
  * Worked with Nil on the scheme perspective Bug # 293093, Have set-up a minimal perspective with an editor by starting from the Schemeway project and
      
    removing all useless dependencies. Once the cleanup is finish we will put it on the bugzilla.

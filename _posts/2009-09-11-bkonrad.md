Hi guys, I&#8217;m the team leader for Basie this term and I look forward to meeting all of you!

I started programming when I was 9 years old (true nerd roots) on an Apple II-E.  The language at the time was BASIC.  I graduated to QBASIC, then C, C++, HTML, JavaScript, C#, VB, SQL, etc, etc, etc.  I used to think that software development is programming, and therefore languages mean everything, but I&#8217;ve discovered that languages are simply tools that have strengths and weaknesses just like anything else.

I love all sorts of web development and have found quite a bit of joy in working with Django&#8217;s MTV (variant of MVC) style framework.  It&#8217;s a real breath of fresh air.

See you soon!

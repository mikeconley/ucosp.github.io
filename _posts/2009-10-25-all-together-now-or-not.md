By the end of this week (Oct 30), each of our teams has to propose a grading scheme they&#8217;d like used for their term&#8217;s work. To do this, they&#8217;ll have to decide (a) what they&#8217;re going to deliver by Friday December 4 (our target wrap-up date) and (b) how much of their grade will depend on the team&#8217;s accomplishments, and how much will depend on individual contributions. Experience shows that the latter is much harder to decide than the former: most people want their grade to reflect what they&#8217;ve done, but clients care about what&#8217;s delivered as a whole.

I can&#8217;t tell students how to make this decision [1], but I can suggest that everyone read Oakley et al&#8217;s paper &#8220;[Turning Student Groups into Effective Teams](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww4.ncsu.edu%2Funity%2Flockers%2Fusers%2Ff%2Ffelder%2Fpublic%2FPapers%2FOakley-paper(JSCL).pdf&ei=UmrkSsyuKI-9lAehwdyKBw&usg=AFQjCNE2loAJZwLiYRNATvucIsfpUmfgFw&sig2=DOgjZJ3xY1xKr_mfnU6BgA)&#8220;. I can also suggest that teams think about grading schemes they&#8217;ve had in other courses that they thought were ambiguous or unfair, and try to make sure that what they hand in on Friday doesn&#8217;t have those faults: I&#8217;ve always hated things like &#8220;software is adequately tested: 10%&#8221; because I never knew what the prof meant by &#8220;adequate&#8221;.

[1] Well, I _could_, but that would defeat one of the main aims of the course&#8230;

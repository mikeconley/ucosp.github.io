  Hey all,
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  My name is Peter Lorimer, I&#8217;m a third/fourth year Computing Science w/ Business Minor student at the University of Alberta. I&#8217;ll be working on the Eclipse4Edu project. I am really excited about this class because I have never really worked on any projects that aren&#8217;t for school projects. I mean this is for school, but it will also be used outside of school. If that makes any sense. After my degree I hope to take my computing knowledge into the oilfield and work on data acquisition hardware and software for downhole tools. This summer I worked for NOV Monoflo and got a taste of what I am in for and I enjoyed it.
</p>

  I wish everyone good luck in this class and look forward to seeing Toronto for the first time. See you all around.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Cheers.

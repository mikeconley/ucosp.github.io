**General Update**

  * Deliverable partially accepted, we are blocked by the IO saturation scenario, brief problem specification as follows: 
      * Variables to monitor are dependent on machines
      * Variables are not feasible to be displayed on a dial
      * Unexpected negative  values appear on variables
      * The plan for now is to keep working on the IO scenario for another week, deliver the video with the best we can do by next Thursday
      * Draft deliverables have been postponed by a week, this will give everyone enough time to stabilize your work, fix everything you don’t feel good about, while working on the next deliverable

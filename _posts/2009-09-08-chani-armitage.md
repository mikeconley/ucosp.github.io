 ![](http://chani.ccdevnet.org/photos/IMG_0020-small.JPG)Hi, I&#8217;m Chani Armitage. I&#8217;m studying comp sci at Simon Fraser University, and previously studied at BCIT. I work on the [KDE](http://www.kde.org) project in my free time. I&#8217;ve done three [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) projects with them now (it&#8217;s awesome, you should apply next spring).

This fall I&#8217;ll be working on the Robocup project. My first programming experience was for an Artificial Life game ([Creatures 3](http://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Creatures_3)), so I&#8217;m looking forward to doing some AI programming. ðŸ™‚

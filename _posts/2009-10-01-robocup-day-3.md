Better late then never!

Day 3 was more productive than I expected it to be.

  * Alex and myself continued researching a third party monitor which provides extra information.
  * Yulia and Patrik have been working on a script to allow someone to easily control a player, through the keyboard.
  * Chani and Ioana have been working on a debugging tool.

We ended the day with a quick meeting to decide how our teams will split up. The two teams are Chani, Ioana, and Myself on one team and Alex, Yulia, and Patrik on the other. Each team will work on three separate improves, compete against each other, and then in the end merge the two clients into one.

We&#8217;re very pleased to welcome our first students from Carleton University in Ottawa, and Memorial University in Newfoundland&#8212;and not just because this means we&#8217;ll have students this term who can dabble their toes in three different oceans :-).  Ah, if only there was a university that bordered the Arctic Ocean&#8230;

This brings the total number of students to 46, which is nearly double our original target of two dozen. The budget for bringing them together Sept 25-27 won&#8217;t stretch much further, so we&#8217;re going to close the door on enrolment for the fall in just a few days.  Students will start posting their biographies soon after that.

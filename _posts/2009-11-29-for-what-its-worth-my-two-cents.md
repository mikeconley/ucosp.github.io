**The good cent:**
  
I would definitely say that the best part of my UCOSP experience has been my project &#8220;mentor&#8221;, [Blake Winton](http://weblog.latte.ca/blake). Â I&#8217;m not sure how he put up with myÂ incessantÂ IRC messages at all times of the day Sunday through Saturday. Â I learned a lot about [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) and distributed version control from him, and he was always so chill that I couldn&#8217;t help but want to work on the [ISPDB](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/ISPDB). Â It&#8217;s too bad he&#8217;s not grading me for the course, otherwise this might be a nice little push towards a good grade ðŸ˜‰

**The bad cent:**
  
In short, the structure. Â I didn&#8217;t bother reading all of the other post mortems so I hope that I&#8217;m not repeating anyone here&#8230;

The long version:
  
The structure of the course made it hard to give it priority equal to my other courses. Â I know that I still put in a good amount of work, but I would have liked to put in more. Â I liked [the idea that &#8220;Greg&#8221; had](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/some-ideas-for-next-term/) (I know your dirty secret on this one Greg, and it&#8217;s safe with me ðŸ™‚ ), Â but I think it still needs more structure. Â If the 3rd suggestion had a percentage of the total grade (like 30%) where you either got your weekly milestone done (or a good blog post about what you came up against that kept you from completion) or you lost a percentage of your total grade. Â As it stands now, it&#8217;s hard to see the realÂ repercussionsÂ of missing milestones since they don&#8217;t have a direct, quantifiable effect on your grade. Â I could go on about this one, but unless someone comments with questions I&#8217;m going to lay this to rest&#8230;

peace.

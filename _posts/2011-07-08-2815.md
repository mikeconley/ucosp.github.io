Lots of things are happening behind the scenes as we gear up for UCOSP again this fall.  Faculty across Canada are recruiting students, we are busy trying to collect a few more projects and finalize the ones we have tentatively arranged, and we are still looking for more sponsors.

We are very grateful to Google for agreeing to be our major sponsor for the second year in a row.  We are also grateful for the enthusiastic support of the [CACS/AIC](http://cacsaic.org/ "CACS/AIC") (the association of Canadain computer science chairs).

I&#8217;d also like to introduce [Reid Holmes](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/ "Reid Holmes") from the University of Waterloo. Reid has joined [Michelle Craig](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mcraig/ "Michelle Craig") , [Eleni Stroulia](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~stroulia/ "Eleni Stroulia"), and myself ([Karen Reid](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid/)) on the steering committee.

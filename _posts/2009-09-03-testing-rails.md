Adam Goucher taught me most of what I know about quality assurance. He&#8217;s now in charge of the same at Zerofootprint, as well as a regular speaker at agile and testing conferences, and has kindly agreed to give the MarkUs team some guidance this fall.  (Basie and Thunderbird teams take note: much of what he says applies to you too.)  His [thirty-second guide](http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1188) is a good place to start; I look forward to hearing more from him.

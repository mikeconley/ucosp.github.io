We&#8217;re all working on our bugs at Team Thunderbird. Tim&#8217;s working on better integration with the Windows 7 taskbar. Kefu is getting the &#8216;From&#8217; address to be automatically determined when replying to a list. Lin is making sure the correct menu options are enabled at the right times. I&#8217;ve also had to deal with this a bit while adding a &#8220;Reopen last tab&#8221; button. Evan is working on importing vCards for Address Book. Marcel is working on some display issues with the activity monitor. Wei Xian is working on being able to restore sessions.

Wei Xian also made a Python script at the code sprint that helps Thunderbird developers on Windows generate a Visual Studio project.

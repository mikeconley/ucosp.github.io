Hi all, I&#8217;m Titus Brown, a professor at Michigan State University. I&#8217;m participating vicariously in UCOSP through several MSU students, and I&#8217;m looking forward to this being a great success (which, note, includes not actually driving Greg stark raving mad) so that I can join in as a project mentor the \*next\* time the program happens.

You can find out more about me at my lab Web page, http://ged.msu.edu/; or my personal blog, http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/; or by asking.Â  And if you&#8217;re interested in getting a PhD in bioinformatics AND doing so while working on open source, we should definitely talk.

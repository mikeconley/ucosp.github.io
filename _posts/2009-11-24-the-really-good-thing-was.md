**Thumbs up:** Our great teamwork. Although we are working in a distributed setting, I do find it astonishing how well everything worked out. People are doing a great job in terms of communication.

**Thumbs down:** Having a pretty tight schedule, I think there was hardly time for one or two developers to go for a [spike](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html) (i.e. looking into an unknown technological area) and create an example solution to a problem.

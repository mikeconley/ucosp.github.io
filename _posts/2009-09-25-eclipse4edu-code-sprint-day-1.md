The Eclipse4Edu team met for the first time this morning. We began to brainstorm new features then split up for pair programming sessions. Nil and I (Dennis) worked together on bug 244643. Peter and Maxime worked together on bug 246087. Unfortunately, Maciej was the odd one out for this session, but he worked on bug 288852. We&#8217;re at the end of our initial two week sprint and we&#8217;ve collectively submitted 3 patches and 1 feature.

In the afternoon we met with Dr. Dwight Deugo and Wayne Beaton (Eclipse Foundation) and went over the development process for the project (and got a few quick lessons in Eclipse platform development).

We&#8217;re looking forward to the rest of the sprint!

**Goal of Sprint 5**

**We need to finalize everything, think about this as the final exam, you will hand in your work on March 31<sup>st</sup>, and you will get graded for the work**

**That is to say, by March 31<sup>st</sup>, you should have no un-closed tickets in the ticket tracker**

**Remaining Tasks:**

  * **Everyone please make your changes according to Matthew\`s comments**
  * **Graphical indicator document should be moved to a wiki page**
  * **Indicator should have a size that people can scale**
  * **For the lock wait tutorial, we want the WMD be better incorporated with the dials, document should be sent to IBM to address the issue**

**Development Process:**

**Matthew – Please create tickets and assign them to individuals on the team**

**Everyone please check out the code at  <https://db2mc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/db2mc/UCOSP/mainline>**

**Then  make your changes, make sure it runs well on your system, and check it back in**

**The idea is to make sure we have a well-integrated TE-UCOSP by March 31<sup>st</sup>**

**Journey entries could be delivered later than March 31st**

  * Move the graphical indicator to wikipage
  * Integrate the new dials before Tuesday

Hi, I&#8217;m Mike Conley, and I&#8217;m one of the TA&#8217;s for this course.  I will be helping Karen Reid manage the MarkUs Project this semester.  I&#8217;m a Masters student at the University of Toronto in the Software Engineering group, and I just finished my undergrad at UofT, doubling in Computer Science and Dramatic Arts.

I&#8217;ve been working on MarkUs since September, 2008.  I&#8217;ve been web programming in one form or another for over a decade, but MarkUs has been my first time working on a fairly sophisticated Ruby on Rails project.

I look forward to meeting some, if not all of you at the Codesprint in late September.  Until then, I&#8217;ll be lurking in the IRC channels (primarily #markus on FreeNode) as m_conley.

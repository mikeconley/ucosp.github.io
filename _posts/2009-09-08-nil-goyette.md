  I&#8217;m currently studying at the Université de Sherbrooke in Québec. Sadly, it&#8217;s my last year, it was starting to be fun.

  As for now, I think I&#8217;m interested in hardware and assembly language. I hope to have some free time to play with the Arduino to see if I really like hardware.

  My native language is french and I don&#8217;t have a lot of opportunity to learn english, so I&#8217;m really happy to work with you. I guess I will learn a lot in Toronto.

Hi, my name is Nil Goyette and I&#8217;m going to work on Eclipse4Edu.

I&#8217;m currently studying at the Université de Sherbrooke in Québec. Sadly, it&#8217;s my last year, it was starting to be fun.

As for now, I think I&#8217;m interested in hardware and assembly language. I hope to have some free time to play with the Arduino to see if I really like hardware.

Next year, I have some interesting projects : Google Summer of Code (thanks for the idea), work [and visit] in Europe, compostelle, a master in something, &#8230; I have yet to decide.

My native language is french and I don&#8217;t have a lot of opportunity to learn english, so I&#8217;m really happy to work with you. I guess I will learn a lot in Toronto.

Au plaisir de vous rencontrer!

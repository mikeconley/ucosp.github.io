As contrasted with some of my students, I&#8217;m fairly happy with the amount of coding work they&#8217;ve gotten done. I think this is largely because I had more realistic expectations coming in to the course. After 15 years in industry I&#8217;ve come to realize that there&#8217;s a whole lot more to fixing bugs than fixing the bug, and the other stuff is what takes the time. Stuff like figuring out what&#8217;s going wrong, and how the code fits together, writing tests, getting it reviewed, fixing the things the reviewer points out, getting it committed, and (hopefully) writing up their weekly status reports.

So, yeah, most of the students seem on track to get their bugs committed by the end of the term, and I&#8217;m pretty happy with that. The only thing I could ask for is more communication. Even though I&#8217;ve been getting more email and seeing more questions in IRC recently, I would also like to see some blog posts so that other people can take advantage of the things the current crop of students are learning.

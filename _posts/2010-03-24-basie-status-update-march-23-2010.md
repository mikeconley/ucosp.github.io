**Road Blocks:**

  * Alex &#8211; Looking for some feedback on timezone tests, mainly for source app. (<a title="Link to review request." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/723/" target="_blank">R723</a>) 
      * Guillaumes will review them and provide feedback.
  * Chris &#8211; Awaiting review for Trac-2-Basie tool. (<a title="Link to review request." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/718/" target="_blank">R718</a>) 
      * Nikita has been given the task as reviewer.
  * Chad &#8211; Need some redirection from Veronica in terms of design. 
      * Veronica and Chad will have discussion.

**Status:**

  * Guillaumes continues with Selenium testing. Tests for the about page has been reviewed by Chris, now awaiting update. Up next for Selenium testing is the Tickets app.
  * Francois also working on Selenium testing. Tests for the Dashboard is under review by Chris. Additionally, tests for admin_database should be up in ReviewBoard really soon.
  * Nikita knocked off 2 tickets off his list (<a title="Link to ticket 305." href="https://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/305/" target="_blank">T305</a>, <a title="Link to ticket 308." href="https://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/308/" target="_blank">T308</a>), both committed. He&#8217;ll be posting a review request for Tagging by tomorrow. Additionally, he&#8217;ll be reviewing Chris&#8217; Trac2basie tool.
  * Veronica continued producing great mockups, <a title="Local Search Mockup PDF." href="http://blog.basieproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Basie-v.0.05-Local-Search.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;Local Search&#8221;</a> and <a title="Global Header Mockup PDF." href="http://blog.basieproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Basie-v.0.05-Project-Switch1.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;Global Header&#8221;</a>. She had a meeting with Tania and discussed about the documentation.
  * Chris once again did quite a few reviews for everyone (<a title="Link to review 566." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/566/" target="_blank">R566</a>, <a title="Link to review 657." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/657/" target="_blank">R657</a>, <a title="Link to review 713." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/713/" target="_blank">R713</a>, <a title="Link to review 715." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/715/" target="_blank">R715</a>, <a title="Link to review 719." href="http://review.basieproject.org/r/719/" target="_blank">R719</a>). Also, Chris has filed several new tickets (<a title="Link to ticket 311." href="https://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/311/" target="_blank">T311</a>, <a title="Link to ticket 312." href="https://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/312/" target="_blank">T312</a>, <a title="Link to ticket 313." href="https://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/313/" target="_blank">T313</a>).
  * Alex has submitted some tests for timezones, should be ready in the next couple of days.
  * Chad has been working hard on getting attachments up, just needs some GUI work. A review request for attachments is planned for next week.
  * Jackie has been working on error messages for milestones, it&#8217;s nearly ready for commit. Next would be error messages for tickets, which should be quick as it&#8217;s really similar to milestones.

[Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/features/) is the award winning email client created by [Mozilla Messaging](https://www.mozillamessaging.com/). Used by millions of people world wide, it is made available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux in over 40 different languages.

Mozilla&#8217;s aims for this term&#8217;s project will be to introduce you to the technological, social, and pragmatic aspects of developing open source software through direct involvement in the project, and secondarily to work on features and bugs in Mozilla Thunderbird 3. The results of your efforts will be rolled in to the next version, Thunderbird 3.1. There is a [list of the potential bugs](http://bit.ly/tb-available-bugs) for you to browse through.

Knowledge of C++ or JavaScript, HTML, and XML is strongly suggested.

Mozilla is a global community of people creating a better internet. We build public benefit into the internet by creating free, open source products and technologies that improve the online experience for people everywhere. We work in the open under the umbrella of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation. Everything we create is a public asset available for others to use, adapt, and improve. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Mozilla, Mozilla Messaging organizes the development and marketing of email and messaging products. This unique structure has enabled Mozilla Messaging to financially support and cultivate competitive, viable community innovation.

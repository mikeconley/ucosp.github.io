I am Severin Gehwolf, a second/third year Computer Science student at University of Toronto. Before coming to Toronto &#8211; starting my second degree &#8211; I was working for almost 2 years. It was then when I realized what interests me most: Software and its very internals.

I got involved with MarkUs and Ruby on Rails during winter term 2009, but really didn&#8217;t do any Rails development until this summer when I started to work on MarkUs full-time. The summer was just great: Great software, great people, great environment. Since I very much enjoyed the summer, I continue to work on MarkUs this fall term. What&#8217;s more, open source development is usually very distributed (I think) and this course seems to address exactly that. Exciting!

Looking forward to see all of you at the code sprint.

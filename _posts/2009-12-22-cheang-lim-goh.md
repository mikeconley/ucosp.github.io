Hi I am Lim, a fourth year Computer Science/Business Option student from the University of Waterloo.

I will be joining the Ingres team next term. My experience lies primarily with C++ but I also speak a little Java and C#. This will be my first time working on a open-source database project, with focus on managing geospatial data, moreover a team as unique as ours! I look forward to working with Prof. Greg and everyone, see you all in January!

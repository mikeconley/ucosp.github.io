Hello, my name is Eric Henry, and I&#8217;ll be working on the Thunderbird project.

I am a computer science major in  my last semester at [Michigan State University](http://www.cse.msu.edu).  Between educational endeavors, I was a freelance web developer working mainly in PHP, with some old projects in ASP (with VB, yuck).  I also have experience working with Flash and ActionScript.  This last semester (Spring 2009) I worked on an open source project in python that was basically an automated build system.

Currently I am interning at [Jackson National Life](http://jackson.com), where I have been working mainly in Java.  My most recent project has been working with an open source continuous integration program called [Hudson](http://hudson.dev.java.net).

I&#8217;m very excited to working with the Thunderbird and Django.

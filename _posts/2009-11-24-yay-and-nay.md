Thumbs up: I think code reviews really helped keep everyone on track and to maintain high standards. Mike did a great job reading and commenting on the reviews. It turned out to be a good form of communication between meetings.

Thumbs not so up: As a supervisor, I just couldn&#8217;t keep up, so it was hard to help steer the progress.

Thumbs down: This is a hard format for a postmortem. It&#8217;s going to be a challenge to collect everything together.

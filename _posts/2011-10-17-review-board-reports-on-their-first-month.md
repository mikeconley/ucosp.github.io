David Druska checks in from Review Board to let us know how the first month has [been going](http://reviewboardstudents.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/ucosp-blog-post-oct-16-2011/). David also provides some nice insight into why code reviews have been an effective part of the Review Board development process.

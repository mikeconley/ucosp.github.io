Hi, my name is Jory Graham, and I&#8217;m looking forward to working with some of you on the elmcity project.

I&#8217;m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, just finishing up my last few courses. I&#8217;m primarily interested in natural language processing (which I plan on continuing to study), and calendar data is no exception. My underlying interests are the subconcious patterns that we all abide by without realizing.

After seeing Jon&#8217;s presentation at Science 2.0, I became very excited in the prospects inherent in elmcity.

Keywords? Python, Emacs, Vim, Cryptic Crosswords, Roguelikes, Randomness, and Deerhoof. I&#8217;d be glad to talk for hours about any of them.

Thumbs up: Mozilla&#8217;s strict coding standards and having to submit patches and get our code reviewed was very beneficial. It forces you to pay attention to details and you learn a lot more compared to projects that you hack together last minute and hand in whatever works ðŸ™‚

Thumbs down: The tasks our team worked on were pretty individual and so there wasn&#8217;t muchÂ collaborationÂ between us.

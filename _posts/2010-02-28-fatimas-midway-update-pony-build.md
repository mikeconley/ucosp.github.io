Few months ago,when I first joined Pony-build, I was excited and eager to learn more about this project in particular and open-source in general. I knew my limited experience might make my progress slower than expected but I was determined to learn more no matter what.
  
I couldn&#8217;t join the UCOSP community for the &#8220;Code Sprint&#8221; in Canada; however, I started to communicate with the project lead Titus C. Brown and the rest of the group via Skype to make the initial system set ups. I encountered many problems throughout the process, but Titus was always patient and very helpful.
  
Getting familiar with Git and the already written codeÂ  took me more than a while. My first build fully worked after few weeks , but when I have started my second one, it took me few hours to get it build and compile which shows the big progress I&#8217;m making.
  
I have also learned how to ask for help from the rest of the group, who have been ready to lend a hand when needed.
  
Today, my enthusiasm remains the same and I&#8217;m ready to learn more.

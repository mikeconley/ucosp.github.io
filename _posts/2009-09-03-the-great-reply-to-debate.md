Earlier today I used our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/ucosp) to ask students for information for the very first time. Of the first dozen who replied, half mailed me back directly; the other half just hit &#8220;reply&#8221;, and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, Google Groups sets message headers to send replies to the whole list by default.

Oops.

So, without further ado, here&#8217;s my first apology of the term&#8212;I should have checked what the default setting was, then changed it. In my defense, though, people have been arguing about what the &#8220;right&#8221; behavior should be for thirty years. Karl Fogel&#8217;s excellent book [_Producing Open Source Software_](http://producingoss.com) has a nice summary, which you can [read here](http://producingoss.com/en/mailing-lists.html#reply-to). While you&#8217;re there, you should also check out his list of [common pitfalls](http://producingoss.com/en/common-pitfalls.html), and learn what &#8220;[painting the bikeshed](http://producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html)&#8221; means.

Onward!

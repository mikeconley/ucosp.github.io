Hi everyone,

my name is Lenny Han. I&#8217;m a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I&#8217;ve worked with Professor Greg Wilson and Diane Horton on several capstone projects in the last two years. In these projects, I dealt with a variety of topics, from Eclipse plugin development, algorithm design, to browser-based application. My main interests are Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. Recently, I&#8217;m thinking of exploring in computer game design and development, since I find a passion in this area. I&#8217;m looking forward to learning new things and starting a career in the fields that I like. In January, I&#8217;m joining a new team (Data Server Flight Simulator) and starting a new project. I hope that we will have fun, work hard, and make a useful piece of tool that every DB admin will love!

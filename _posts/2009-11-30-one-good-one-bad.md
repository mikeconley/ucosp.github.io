Good

The code sprint.  Hands down the most fun part of the course for me (as it was last year), I enjoyed meeting the smart people who make up the Basie team and solving a few key design problems.  The Basie team came from all over, and it was a blast.

The Bad

Remote, remote, remote.  I know that this business &#8220;can be done from anywhere&#8221;, but it&#8217;s just not the same IMO.  I set up some phone chats this term that hopefully made everything a bit more human, but more of that would have been great.  If I was in charge I would require that a student doing a code review for another student have AT LEAST one &#8220;real&#8221; discussion about the purpose of the code in question.  The process of explaining one&#8217;s code very often reveals shortfalls or room for awesome improvement.

Just my two cents (we have a lot of cents here now!)

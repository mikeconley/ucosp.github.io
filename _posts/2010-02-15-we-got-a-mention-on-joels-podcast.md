Thanks to a leading question from Pierre Lafayette, Joel Spolsky mentioned us in a recent postcast &#8212; you can listen to the whole thing at  http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4403.html (around the 40-minute mark).  Yay us! But I do have to correct one thing: in response to Pierre pointing out that $2000 is a bit pricey for most undergrads, Joel says, &#8220;Just ask your university library to get it for you.&#8221; In reality, university library budgets are being slashed left, right, and center; asking them to get anything that isn&#8217;t obviously scholarly isn&#8217;t going to go anywhere 🙁

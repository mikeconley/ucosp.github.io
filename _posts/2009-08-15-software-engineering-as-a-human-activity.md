The [previous post](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/bad-habits-and-more-than-a-little-marketing/) touched on the need for more emphasis on evidence-based results in software engineering. This is a rapidly growing area of research&#8212;many of the papers at this year&#8217;s International Conference on Software Engineering ([ICSE&#8217;09](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/home/)) presented, included, or referenced experiments or field studies of one kind or another.

Alongside this, there is growing interest in software engineering as a human activity, which has led many researchers to look at fields like social psychology. Some findings that might be particularly relevant to undergraduates working in teams touch on:

  * [procrastination](http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/01/how-to-avoid-procrastination-think.php),
  * [social loafing](http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/05/social-loafing-when-groups-are-bad-for-productivity.php),
  * [group norms killing creativity](http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/06/why-group-norms-kill-creativity.php), and
  * [group behavior](http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/07/10-rules-that-govern-groups.php).

We will look at a handful of selected results during this course.

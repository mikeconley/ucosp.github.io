I&#8217;m very glad to have the chance to work with you guys on Markus.

I&#8217;ve been enjoying programming ever since the first time I said &#8220;hello world&#8221; in C. Now my major languages are C-style ones such as Java and C#, and I&#8217;m now working with ASP.net web development. I&#8217;m eager to learn new technologies, and I believe it&#8217;ll be a joy to shift to Ruby on Rails from my past experience.

I think it&#8217;s very cool that people from different regions working on the same project can actually deliver a high-quality product. This makes me feel people are brought more closer to each other, and that&#8217;s why open-source projects attract me so much.

Can wait to meet everybody on code sprint!

Best wishes!

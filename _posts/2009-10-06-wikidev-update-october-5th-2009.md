We had our first meeting after the code sprint today. The main points from the meeting are that, the <span style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">three subteams should develop a wiki page describing the incremental tests they want to accomplish with an initial deadline of October 7, 2009. These tests will be evolving over time as the teams accomplish their different tasks. Another major point was to create tickets for any non trivial changes required and how a single ticket can be assigned to multiple people. In overall the teams were progressing very well and there were no doubts about the next steps to take.<br /> </span>

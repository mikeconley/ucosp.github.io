I [posted a link](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/all-nighters-lower-your-grades/) last week to Evan Robinson&#8217;s article explaining [why crunch mode doesn&#8217;t work](http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons). Coincidentally, Ruben Ortega&#8217;s latest post on the ACM site asks, Why Do Software Developers Tolerate &#8220;Crunch Time&#8221;? His answer is &#8220;progress&#8221;, or at least, developers&#8217; need to feel like they&#8217;re making progress. A couple of paragraphs later, though, he says:

> It is unrealistic to deliver any project without going through some &#8220;Crunch time.&#8221;

I personally think _that_ is the root of the problem. If you believe broken builds are inevitable, you&#8217;re not going to work very hard to make sure that code always compiles. If you believe that users are dumb, you&#8217;re not going to put much effort into fixing your user interface. And if you believe that it&#8217;s unrealistic to deliver code without all-nighters, guess what? You&#8217;re going to wind up pulling all-nighters.

So here&#8217;s _my_ data. I haven&#8217;t stayed up to see the sunrise since the night my daughter was born, and you&#8217;d have to go back at least 15 years before that to my previous all-nighter. Despite that&#8212;no, _because of_ that&#8212;I get a fair bit done on time and on spec. My algorithm is pretty simple:

  1. List the things that need to be done.
  2. Figure out which ones really matter, and which ones don&#8217;t.
  3. Estimate how long each one is going to take.
  4. Sort.
  5. Start work.

For every thing I do, there&#8217;s a dozen that I set aside. I always feel a pang of regret (sometimes two), but trying to do everything is a good way to accomplish nothing. And while it took me twenty years to learn how, I&#8217;m not pretty good at abandoning things that are half done if it turns out that they&#8217;re not as important, or as doable, as I thought they were. (&#8220;I&#8217;ve started so I&#8217;ll finish&#8221; sounds macho, but it&#8217;s lousy project management.)

I&#8217;ve also learned to ask people, &#8220;Is this a good idea?&#8221; _before_ I put too much work into it. This one was hard too; I&#8217;ve always enjoyed walking into a room and saying, &#8220;Ta da, look what I&#8217;ve done!&#8221; These days, though, I&#8217;ll ask my wife or a fellow prof or a student what they think before I start writing or coding. As my dad used to say, &#8220;A week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought.&#8221;

So: what&#8217;s _your_ strategy for getting things done? How well does it work? And do you think you&#8217;re getting better at it?

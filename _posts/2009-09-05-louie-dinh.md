Hi, I&#8217;m Louie Dinh and I will be working on the ThunderBird Project.

I&#8217;m a third year Computer Science Major/Biology Minor at the University of British Columbia. Eventually I plan to attend graduate school in biology and teach them a thing or two about good software development practices (hence this course). The history of computing has always fascinated me and I still regret not being born 10 years earlier to be a part of the explosion of personal computing and the Internet. My inherent laziness made learning to program an obvious choice. Why do something if you can tell your little sister&#8230;I mean a computer&#8230;how to do it instead?

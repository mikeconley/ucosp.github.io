As I&#8217;ve [written](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/bad-habits-and-more-than-a-little-marketing/) [earlier](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/software-engineering-as-a-human-activity/), an increasing amount of research in software engineering is focused on empirical studies of what actually works (or doesn&#8217;t) in the real world. A [new paper](http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MS.2009.114) from Moe, Dingsøyr, and Dybå reports a multi-year study of teams in several companies implementing Scrum. Key problems they identified include:

  * Over-specialization: if each module &#8220;belongs&#8221; to one developer, it&#8217;s hard for the group as a whole to design and plan, because no one knows enough to get a big picture view.
  * Unclear completion criteria: if team members don&#8217;t know how to tell when something&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s difficult for them to plan and prioritize.
  * Meetings that are not engaging: self-explanatory.
  * Lack of team autonomy: in particular, if managers constantly come along and say, &#8220;Never mind the plan, fixing this bug is now your top priority,&#8221; people stop caring about making plans in the first place.
  * Impression management: if managers give _their_ managers the impression that a team is better than it actually is, then the team will be given goals that are impossible to meet.
  * Resource contention: developers who are working on two or more projects in parallel always have to decide who to disappoint.  (Note: students are usually working on five courses at once&#8230;)

The paper suggests solutions for all of these problems, but they basically come down to &#8220;use common sense&#8221;.  It&#8217;ll be interesting at the end of term to see which of the traps on this list we&#8217;ve fallen into, and whether we can improve next time &#8217;round.

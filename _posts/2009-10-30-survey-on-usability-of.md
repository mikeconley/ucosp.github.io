I just compiled the results from the survey i did about Integrated Development Environment for the Eclipse4Edu project.
  
The survey was first set-up by Dennis Acosta but i did a french version of the form. These results contain only the feedback from Sherbrooke university students for now.

Surprisingly more people use the debugger and refactoring features then i would have thought. Also most people said they would not use their built-in ide tutorials.

I would also appreciate your opinion on all this.

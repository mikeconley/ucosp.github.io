On Friday morning, 45 strangers sat down to work on this term&#8217;s UCOSP projects. On Sunday, after three solid days of coding, talking, and learning, seven software development teams headed home. It was a long haul (especially for our visitors from the west coast and the Caribbean), but a lot of fun. I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who took part, especially Alan Rosenthal, Carolyn Ursabia, Mike Conley, and Zuzel Vera Pacheco, who helped set everything up and run smoothly. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next eleven weeks a lot.

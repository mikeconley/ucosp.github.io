A couple of people have emailed to ask why their university isn&#8217;t included in the list of who&#8217;s taking part in Winter 2010. The answer is that we haven&#8217;t been able to find a faculty member willing to anchor things there, or that no students have stepped forward (usually because they&#8217;re already in year-long capstone projects). All hope is not yet lost, though: we&#8217;d be happy to hear from anyone who&#8217;d like to join us, even at this late date.

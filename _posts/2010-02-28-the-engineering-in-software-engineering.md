My first degree is in engineering, and while I&#8217;m too clumsy to have ever actually practiced [1], the courses I took still shape the way I look at things. In particular, I still enjoy articles like [this one](http://carlos.bueno.org/2010/02/measuring-javascript-parse-and-load.html),which reports parse and load times for Javascript on various platforms. I really wish that a course on systems performance was a standard part of every undergrad CS degree; I doubt that&#8217;ll happen any time soon, but this stuff is out there if you look for it. And see also this post about [scaling up Django](http://djangoadvent.com/1.2/scaling-django/) &#8212; again, there&#8217;s lots of good engineering thinking on show.

The official goal of this course is to give students first-hand experience of working in distributed teams. There are lots of other lessons to be learned, though, lessons that can only be learned by working on real applications. Take the [performance bug](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1567) that we just found in Basie, or the seemingly-simple problem of deleting tags ([1](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006367.html), [2](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006368.html), [3](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006369.html), [4](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006370.html), [5](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006371.html), [6](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006372.html), [7](http://basieproject.org/pipermail/basie-commits/2009-November/006381.html)). Neither is a coding bug: in both cases, we&#8217;re going to have to re-think a significant chunk of the system&#8217;s design. Problems like this just don&#8217;t come up in assignment-sized programs; as Simon Peyton-Jones [observed](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/right-size.html) in another context, scaling things up often changes their nature in important ways. It takes more effort for students to ramp up, but we think it&#8217;s worth it&#8212;do you?

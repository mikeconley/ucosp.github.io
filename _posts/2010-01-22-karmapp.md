Spent two days out of commission this week after a botched attempt to improve the performance of my integrated Intel 945 chipset ended up freezing gdm on startup. Oops. Several failed attempts to rectify the fault by rolling back xorg.conf (this was not the problem, apparently), one careful repartitioning, a hasty install of Karmic, and countless apt-gets later, I&#8217;m back in action. I note happily that the Karmic repos bundle mercurial 1.3 by default, which means I can finally use pbranch and get the benefit of automatic upgrades. Yay!

Hopefully I&#8217;ll have something more directly productive to post next time; until then, happy hacking!

Hello, everyone. I&#8217;m John Peters and I&#8217;ll be working on Basie.

I&#8217;m in my fourth and final year of my computing science degree at the University of Alberta. In a way I&#8217;m still readjusting to university life, having just come off a sixteen month internship between my third and fourth year working on plasma donation and management software. During a previous summer I worked for the [University of Alberta GAMES Group](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/) on the [ScriptEase](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~script/) project.

I&#8217;ve been trying to keep my undergraduate experience as varied as possible &#8211; hence this course. I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting and working with another (somewhat smaller) team again. See you all at the sprint!

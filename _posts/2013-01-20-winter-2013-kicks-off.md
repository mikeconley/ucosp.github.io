This term&#8217;s code sprint was held at Facebook Headquarters in California. Holding the sprint outside of Canada was a first for UCOSP, but it enabled us to join up with 110 students from several US and International schools that were also holding a similar weekend hackfest on the Facebook campus. This term 43 students from 19 Canadian universities are working on 7 different projects. Photos to follow.

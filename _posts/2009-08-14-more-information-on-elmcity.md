Jon Udell has put up a blog post with (much) [more information about the ElmCity project](http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/08/10/two-projects-for-civic-minded-student-programmers/). As he sees it, there&#8217;s scope for both a general calendar data scraper, and a hybrid system for finding information about recurring events and making it explicit.Â  Lots of room here to do a lot of creative things&#8230;

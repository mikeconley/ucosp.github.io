There are a number of tools available, both open-source and commercial which get lumped into the bucket of &#8216;functional testing tools&#8217;. _Essentially_ they help you, well, test the functionality of your application.

One of these tools for testing web-based applications is [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org). Selenium has at its core three different components: a record/playback tool (Se-IDE), language bindings (Se-RC) and a distributed execution framework (Se-Grid).

I put up a post on my blog called [The Selenium Value Chain](http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1198) which briefly discusses each and the progression between them. For teams working on web-based projects, Se might be a strategy you employ to help build a regression suite for your new (or the existing) features.

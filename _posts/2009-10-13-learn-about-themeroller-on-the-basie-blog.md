On the Basie blog I recently made [a post](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1369) about the jQuery UI Themeroller tool and why it&#8217;s useful. One of my purposes for making the post was to draw some input about the current color theme in Basie. As developers we don&#8217;t have to make these types of decisions every day, but it&#8217;s still quite an important one. At the very least take a look and learn a bit about jQuery UI, you might find it useful some day down the road!

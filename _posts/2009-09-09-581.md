Hey, I&#8217;m Ainsley, and I&#8217;ll be working on MarkUs this semester.

I&#8217;m going into my final year at U of T Scarborough, where I am doing a double major in Computer Science and Psychology.Â  The plan is to go to grad school (for CS) after I graduate.

This summer, I worked for Professor Steve Easterbrook to develop a tool that helps software development teams understand improve their social networks (research blog [here](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ainsley/summer09.html)). Last year in Greg&#8217;s 494 course, I worked for a psychology professor and wrote a video game ( in Flash) that&#8217;s meant to help seniors improve their peripheral vision skills.

I also work as a TA for first year comp sci classes at UTSC, which makes MarkUs a particularly appealing project to me.

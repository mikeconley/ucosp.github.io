The Good: I, for one, really loved the grad school talk, I think that it was very insightful and I&#8217;m really glad that we got the opportunity to attend it.

The Bad: Can&#8217;t do pair programming when team members are 500km away üôÅ This might be a personal preference but I&#8217;m a huge fan of pair programming, I find development a lot smoother and it&#8217;s also easy to stay motivated and on track. I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t be the last time I work in a team setting like this, so I guess all in all it&#8217;s a good experience to go through.

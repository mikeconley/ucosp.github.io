A big hello to the Computer Science departments at [Minnesota State University](http://cset.mnsu.edu/cs/) and the [University of the Virgin Islands](http://www.uvi.edu/sites/uvi/Pages/DSM-Computer_Science-Home.aspx?s=AC), where [Prof. Steven Case](http://case.cs.mnsu.edu/) is now trying to recruit a few students to join us for the fall.Â  Two weeks &#8217;til we launch&#8212;we have a lot of organizing to do, but it&#8217;s going to be fun.

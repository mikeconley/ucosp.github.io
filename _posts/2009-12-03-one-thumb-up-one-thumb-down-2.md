Thumbs up: They way the students on the project came together and worked as a team, holding IRC meetings, sharing emails and conference calls.

Thumbs down: The project started off slower than expected, in part to the existing infrastructure and rules of interaction with Eclipse projects and with me becoming familiar with supervising such a unique student course experience.

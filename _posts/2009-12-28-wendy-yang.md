Hi, I&#8217;m Wendy Yang. I&#8217;m a 4th year Computer Science student in University of Waterloo. I will be working with the Mercurial team next term.
  
I have software development experience using C, C++, Java, C#, VB through my co-op terms and school projects.Â  I&#8217;m very glad to have the opportunity to work with everyone in UCOSP. I&#8217;m looking forward to meet everybody in the code sprint.

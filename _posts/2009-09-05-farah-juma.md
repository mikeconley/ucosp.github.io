I&#8217;m a fourth year computer science student at the University of Toronto. I&#8217;m doing a specialist in artificial intelligence. I just completed a 16-month internship at Red Hat, as part of the Professional Experience Year program at U of T. I was on the JBoss Application Server team. It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot!

I really enjoy programming and I&#8217;m excited to be working on MarkUs. I am looking forward to meeting everyone!

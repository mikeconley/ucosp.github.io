The open source communities have no shortage of generous people!  We have nine projects ready to go and 28 wonderful mentors to work with students. I'd like to welcome back returning mentors from Reviewboard, MarkUs, Umple, Mylyn, and Firefox Code Coverage.  I'd especially like to welcome Greg Mierzwinski who is returning as a mentor for Firefox Code Coverage after working on it as a UCOSP student.

We have four new projects from Mozilla: Firefox 3D Z-index Tool, TaskCluster-Pulse, Pontoon, and FlyWeb.  The projects all look very interesting, and I'd like to thank all the new mentors for joining us.

I encourage you to go read the project [descriptions](/projects.html).

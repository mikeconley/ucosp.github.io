The first day of this term&#8217;s code sprint has come and gone. Donuts and pizza were eaten, coffee was drunk, people who&#8217;d only met virtually introduced themselves in person, and a whole lotta software was installed, explained, and fixed. (&#8220;You want it to run on a Mac? I don&#8217;t think it does that&#8230;&#8221;) Blake Winton (Thunderbird), Andrew Ross (Ingres), Karen Reid (University of Toronto), and Steven Case (Minnesota State University) spent most or all of the day with us, and we had a few other visitors as well:

  * Andrew Overhold and Deepak Bhole (Red Hat) and Ben Newton (First Media Group) came down to introduce themselves. Without sponsorship from their companies and others, the event wouldn&#8217;t have been possible; we&#8217;re very grateful for their support.
  * Dave Bolter, an accessibility expert at Mozilla, came in to talk and give demos.
  * Adam Goucher, our tame testing guru, showed off Selenium and talked about [SLIME](http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=130).
  * Peter Kohlmann, Matthew Vandenbuss, and the rest of the IBM team hosted the Data Centre Flight Simulator students up at their lab. We got &#8217;em all back at the end of the day, though, so that&#8217;s OK ðŸ™‚

Thanks as well to the staff at Bright Pearl, who fed us all dinner (in Mike&#8217;s case, twice). Thanks also to Carolyn Ursabia for handling arrangements, and to Alan Rosenthal, our indefatigable sys admin, for making everything run so smoothly. Our second day starts in two and a half hours; I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what everyone accomplishes.

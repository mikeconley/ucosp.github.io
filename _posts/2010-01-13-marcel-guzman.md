Hi all! My name is Marcel Guzman and I&#8217;m a 4th year student at SFU. My interests lie in online development of all kinds (from low-level networking to high-level web app[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1998" title="Marcel Guzman" src="http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/cake.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="266" />](http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/cake.jpg)s and everything in between!). I also enjoy esoteric languages as well as operating systems.

This semester, I&#8217;ll be working on Thunderbird. I&#8217;m very interested in Mozilla projects as well as learning how to code desktop apps so I think it will be a great fit for me. I&#8217;ve previously worked as a co-op with Electronic Arts (Sports Online) and SAP (Crystal Reports Server), both of which were primarily C++ jobs. When I&#8217;m not coding, I enjoy board games, skiing, and as pictured, nomming delicious cake.

Looking forward to the upcoming sprint

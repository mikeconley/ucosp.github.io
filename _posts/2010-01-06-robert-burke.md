Hello!
  
I&#8217;m in my final term of a Bachelor of Computer Science. I&#8217;ve learned from co-ops at Maplesoft, RIM, Amazon.com and Next Level Games, where I&#8217;ve been a scriptor, a build monkey, a manual tester, a Java jockey, and a C++ centurion. I have no favourite language, because I can pick them up easily enough. Â I enjoy solving problems and learning new things.

I&#8217;ll be working on the MarkUs Project this term from winter-laden Waterloo. I&#8217;m excited to meet everyone at the code sprint next weekend!

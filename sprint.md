The fall 2012 sprint is just around the corner; this page will provide a general overview of the schedule for the sprint. If you have any questions, please get in touch via info@ucosp.ca and we will try to answer your question and update the page with additional information. 

## A [Venue map](http://goo.gl/maps/aqIV0) has been set up with the main relevant locations for the sprint.

All students and mentors will be staying in the [Delta hotel](https://local.google.com/maps?q=Delta+Kitchener+Waterloo+Hotel,+King+Street+East,+Kitchener,+ON,+Canada&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=80.335305,169.101563&oq=delta+kitchener&hq=Delta+Kitchener+Waterloo+Hotel,+King+Street+East,+Kitchener,+ON,+Canada&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A) in Kitchener. The sprint will be just down the road at the [Communitech hub](https://local.google.com/maps?q=Delta+Kitchener+Waterloo+Hotel,+King+Street+East,+Kitchener,+ON,+Canada&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=80.335305,169.101563&oq=delta+kitchener&hq=Delta+Kitchener+Waterloo+Hotel,+King+Street+East,+Kitchener,+ON,+Canada&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A). 

We have sent email to everyone with your reservation details for the Delta; these include the name of your roommate as well as your confirmation code. Also, by now you should have made all necessary travel arrangements to make it to the sprint; if any leg of your journey hasn&#8217;t been planned, please get that sorted as soon as possible. 

It is important that we get started promptly on Friday so if you could arrive at Communitech a few minutes early that would be great. There is a small coffee shop if you need a jolt to start the day. It is _strongly_ recommended that everyone bring their own laptop to the sprint so you can set up your development environment and hit the ground running. If you do not have a laptop, please ask around either at your home school to borrow one or with the other members of your team to see if anyone has a machine you can borrow for the weekend. If you cannot find a laptop, just let your mentor know and expect to be doing some pair programming during the sprint. The wireless network at Communitech is open so no credentials will be needed for the sprint.
